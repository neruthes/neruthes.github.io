<p>Nercca cards are issued and managed by NRC.</p>

<p>Nercca card holders may optionally connect their travel documents to the card account. This will allow them to board with connected travel documents instead of their Nercca cards. The name on the card is customizable, however, if the card holder would like to claim replacement in the event of loss, the name on the card must align to un travel document of the card holder and the travel document is thereby connected to the card account.</p>

When boarding the train, the passenger will receive un notification indicating their seat number, if there is still any unallocated seat in economy class.</p>
