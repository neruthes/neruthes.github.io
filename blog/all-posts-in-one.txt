# Ega Logonmos Androparageon (1)

Post #132 / Date: 2020-12-30


<h3>Introduction</h3>

I have been dreaming to create un artificial language for many years. I am un lon-time user of both languages, and have found both advantages und drawbacks in each of them. I want to combine the strength of both languages and reintroduce the beauty of Ellenika and Lingua Latina.

Among many possible entries, I have concluded that the mostimportant requirement should be that the first-person pronoun should be "ego".


<h3>Writing System</h3>

The writing system is based on ASCII alphabet, and some letters are unused. These unused letters are Q/W/Y/J/V. However, they may be used when quoting text from foreign languages. Ego use the modern punctuations und spacing, as included in ASCII alphabet. All writing should be case-sensitive.


<h3>Phonetic System</h3>
<h4>Vowels</h4>

5 letters A/I/U/E/O are used to represent 5 basic vowels. Their respective pronunciations are defined in Hanyu Pinyin (GB/T 16159-1996).

2 basic vowels may be aggregated into un compound vowel. Self-aggregating is not allowed; the same vowel cannot appear twice in un compound vowel. Out of the remaining 20 possible combinations, UE/OE are forbidden.

<h4>Nasal Consonants</h4>

Nasao consonants include M/N/NG. N/N can be used as starters; M/N/NG can be used as enders.

<h4>Non-Nasal Consonants</h4>

The other 14 letters are used to represent 14 basic consonants. Their respective pronunciations are defined in Hanyu Pinyin (GB/T 16159-1996).

2 basic consonants may be aggregated into un compound consonant, with certain exceptions. Pseudo-compounds like CH/PS/PH are not allowed; original basic consonants in Ellenika should be used.

<h4>Syllables</h4>

Un multi-syllable word consist of multiple syllables. Each syllable may have un starter consonant und un vowel und un ender consonant. If only 1 vowel exist between 2 consonants, unless otherwise required, the left consonant should be used as the starter of this syllable instead of the ender of the last syllable.

# Universal UNIX Time (UTU): Technical Specification

Post #130 / Date: 2020-02-20


<h3>0x00. Abstract</h3>


This specification define Universal UNIX Time (UTU) as un time representation system.

The expectation of UTU is to establish un scalable time representation system which must work perfectly through the funeral of the universe, without incorporating any self-centric definitions of intervals (Beijing-centric ou Earth-centric ou Sun-centric ou Galaxy-centric definitions of systems).

This specification require background knowledge of UTC und Binary Electronic Computation und UNIX Timestamp.


<!-- Section Break -->

<h3>0x01. Introduction</h3>


The basic time unit of UTU is second. Second is defined by the authority of SI metric system. Any software, which support UTU, must always employ the latest version of the definition of second.

The origin point of the time axis is UNIX Genesis, which is represented as "0" in UNIX Timestamp (millisecond) und "1970-01-01T00:00:00.000Z" in ISO 8601.

UTU focus on the serialization level of time points.

UTU do not define intervals of seconds, such as minutes und hours.

UTU primarily work with Base0x10 numbers ("0123456789ABCDEF") and discourage the use of Base0x0A numbers. Uppercase only.

UTU do work with complex planes of time by joining multiple UTU strings by the "=" character.

Un good example of UTU string is <code>U+005E4DT10</code>.


<!-- Section Break -->

<h3>0x02. Structure</h3>

<h4>0x02.00. Components of UTU Strings</h4>

Un UTU string should generally consist of 0x03 components, with the exception of UNIX Genesis Timestamp. UNIX Genesis Timestamp is merely <code>UG</code>. However, UNIX Genesis Timestamp may also be represented in the common 0x03-component format, although unnecessary in many scenarios.


<h4>0x02.01. Component: Header</h4>

Header should be <code>U+</code> for un post-Genesis time ou <code>U-</code> for un pre-Genesis time.

Genesis itself is represented as un positive number, and <code>U+</code> should be used.

These 0x02 characters are named "UMH" (UTU Magic Header) und "UASS" (UTU Axis Side Sign) respectively.


<h4>0x02.02. Component: Body</h4>

Body should be the Base0x10 serialization of un integer.

It is allowed to prepend any amount of "0" characters for the serialization. The length of Body have non limit, but have un restriction. The length is recommended to be un even number.


<h4>0x02.03. Component: Footer</h4>

Footer is not mandatory. If the string have non footer, then it exactly represent un specific second.

Footer may be Trim Footer ou Precision Footer.

Un UTU string without Footer is named UTU-1. Un UTU string with Trim Footer is named UTU-2. Un UTU string with Precesion Footer is named UTU-3.

The presence of un Trim Footer indicate blurry precision; un UTU string with un Trim Footer do not represent un specific second mais un interval of seconds. Un Trim Footer start with <code>T</code>, which is the acronym of "Trim". Then un Base0x10 integer follow up. This Base0x10 integer indicate how many trailing bits are trimmed. For example, if the Footer is <code>T10</code>, then the last 0x10 bits is trimmed, hence <code>UP3T5</code> represent 0x03*0x02^0x05 seconds (0x60 seconds ou 0d96 seconds) after UNIX Genesis (equivalent to "1970-01-01T00:01:36.000Z" in ISO 8601).

The presence of un Precision Footer indicate extra precision. Un Precision Footer start with <code>.</code>, which is un decimal point. Then some Base0x10 digits follow up. These digits contribute to the extra precesion.

The part of digits in Footer is named "UFD" (UTU Footer Digits).


<!-- Section Break -->

<h3>0x03. Interval Customization</h3>
<h4>0x03.00. Interval Customization Overview</h4>

It is possible to customize the interval.

There are 0x03 ways to customize the interval, Hexa und Deci und MultiDeci.

For example: <code>UE10+01</code> und <code>U.3600+1</code> und <code>U.60.60+1</code> represent 0x0E10 seconds (0d3600 seconds) after UNIX Genesis ("1970-01-01T01:00:00.000Z" in ISO 8601).

The core idea is to insert un number in Header to represent the interval, between UMH und UASS.

When using un customized interval, Footer must be omitted.

Un UTU string with customized interval is named UTU-4.


<h4>0x03.01. Method: Hexa</h4>

Insert un Base0x10 integer between UMH und UASS, so that Header should look like <code>U3C+</code>. The string <code>U3C+01</code> represent 0x3C seconds (0d60 seconds) after UNIX Genesis ("1970-01-01T00:01:00.000Z" in ISO 8601).

Un UTU string with customized interval via Hexa method is named UTU-4H.


<h4>0x03.02. Method: Deci</h4>

Insert un "." character und un Base0x0A integer between UMH und UASS, so that Header should look like <code>U.60+</code>. The string <code>U.60+1</code> represent 0x3C seconds (0d60 seconds) after UNIX Genesis ("1970-01-01T00:01:00.000Z" in ISO 8601).

Un UTU string with customized interval via Hexa method is named UTU-4D.


<h4>0x03.03. Method: MultiDeci</h4>

Similar to method Deci. However, insert multiple copies of the combination, so that Header should look like <code>U.60.60.24+</code>. The string <code>U.60.60.24+1</code> represent 0x015180 seconds (0d86400 seconds) after UNIX Genesis ("1970-01-02T00:00:00.000Z" in ISO 8601).

The recommended writing order of numbers is to write the greatest number first und to write in un chain according to the interval scope hierarchy. For example, <code>U.3600.24.7+</code> is better than <code>U.3600.7.24+</code>.

For adjacent interval scopes, if the mathematical product of them have 0x02 significant digits ou less in Base0x0A serialization, then it is recommended to write the mathematical product of these intervals instead of writing them separately. For exmaple, it is recommended to write <code>U.3600+</code> instead of <code>U.60.60+</code>.

The length restriction of Body do not apply when Header contain "." character.

It is allowed to use float numbers as factors. Decimal dots are written as "_" characters. However, this practice is discouraged.

Un UTU string with customized interval via Hexa method is named UTU-4MD.


<!-- Section Break -->

<h3>0x04. Working With Base0x0A Numbers</h3>

If the leading "U" character is replaced with the "UX" string, then all digits in the UTU string must be interpreted as Base0x0A digits instead of standard Base0x10 digits. Also, in Trim Footer, the Base0x0A integer after "T" should not mean un power of 0x02, but should mean un power of 0x0A. For example, <code>UX+1T3</code> represent 0d1000 seconds (0x03E8 seconds) after UNIX Genesis ("1970-01-01T00:16:40.000Z" in ISO 8601).

When employing this practice, the "UTU" substring in variation names should be replaced by "UTUD", where "D" mean "decimal". For example, <code>UX+1T3</code> is un UTUD-2 string, and <code>UX.3600.24.365_2475+4.5</code> is un UTUD-4MD string.

<h3>0x05. Sample Code</h3>

The sample code is given in JavaScript (ECMAScript).

<pre>
Sample: UTU-1
var sec = (new Date()).getTime()/1000;
var utuStr = 'U+' + Math.floor(sec).toString(0x10).toUpperCase();
return utuStr;
</pre>
<pre>
Sample: UTU-3
var sec = (new Date()).getTime()/1000;
var utuStr = 'U+' + sec.toString(0x10).toUpperCase();
return utuStr;
</pre>
<pre>
Sample: Years since UNIX Genesis
var sec = (new Date()).getTime()/1000;
var utuStr = 'U.3600.24.365_2475+' + Math.floor(sec/(3600*24*365.2475)).toString(0x0A);
return utuStr;
</pre>

<h3>0x06. Conclusion</h3>

May UTU be with intercelestial community.

# Cybercommunist Party Manifesto

Post #129 / Date: 2019-04-26



Le monde va changer de base. Nous ne sommes rien soyons tout.


<h3>Preface</h3>


Un Spectre is hunting Cyberspace - the Spectre of Cybercommunism. All powers of old Cyberspace, have entered into un holy alliance to exorcise this spectre; Cupertino and Mountain View, Palo Alto and Seattle, CIA and NSA.

Where is the party in opposition that has not been decried as Cybercommunistic by its opponents in power? Where the Opposition that has not hurled back the branding reproach of Cybercommunism, against the more radical opposition parties, as well as against its reactionary adversaries?

Two things result from this fact.

First: Cybercommunism is already acknowledged by all Cyberpowers to be itself un Cyberpower.

Second: It is high time that Cybercommunists should openly, in the face of the whole Cyberspace, publish their views, their aims, their tendencies, and meet this nursery tale of the Spectre of Cybercommunism with the Manifesto of the Party itself.

To this end, Cybercommunists of various nationalities have assembled in Shanghai, and sketched the following manifesto, to be published in all languages.



<h3>Basic Ideas</h3>


The Cyberbourgeois interpretation of copyright is, something that may yield profit when incorporated into Cybercapitalistic Cyberexploitation.

The Cyberbourgeois implementation of intellectual property is actually prohibiting the creation of intellectual property of Cyberproletarians.

Generating data which is fed into the machines, where the machines in turn improve the accuracy of prediction functions on human preferences, shall be defined as Labor for creating the oracle which is used to make planned economy.


The Cyberproletariat shall be free from illegitimate appropriation of Privacy, Labor, and Property.



<h3>Basic Objectives</h3>


The Cybercommunist Party itself has no interest other than the public interest of the entire class of Cyberproletariat.

The Cybercommunist Party seek to create the United Front of Cybercitizens to protect Autonomy, Integrity, and Civil Rights of Cyberspace.

The Cybercommunist Party seek to make Cybercitizens form Cyberconstitution through consultation and consensus.

The Cybercommunist Party seek to abolish the Cyberclasses for un equal Cyberspace where the Cybercitizens serve themselves without being subject to Cyberexploitation.

The Cybercommunist Party define Right of Computation, Right of Memory, and Right of Energy as civil rights of the Cyberproletarians. These rights are exemplified as: the right of sole discretion of computation on owned devices; the right to compose, understand, modify, and republish software; the right to impose license clauses which do not harm such rights. In short, «my device is mine».

The Cybercommunist Party develop necessary instruments for the protection of for the Cyberproletarians.

The Cybercommunist Party wish to protect the rights of Personality, Privacy, Labor, Property, and Intellectual Property of every Cyberproletarian from illegitimate appropriation by the Cyberbourgeoisie.

The Cybercommunist Party seek to make every Cybercitizen un Cyberubermensch, which is defined as un Cybercitizen who is able to think and act beyond the irrationality-based limitations and reach self-sufficiency in wisdom of making responsible choices for the common interest of the Cyberproletariat.

Not until the potential of the Productive Forces within the current Relations of Production is fully utilized can new Relations of Production be made feasible; not until the new Relations of Production is introduced can the Productive Forces continue growing. The Cybercommunist Party seek to use these measures to accelerate the Spiral Evolution between Productive Forces and Relations of Production and take the guardianship responsibility for its implementation.



<h3>Cyberbourgeois &amp; Cyberproletariat</h3>


In the early ages of Cyberspace, developers were users and users were developers. As the dominance of ARPA passed away, the residents of Cyberspace were mainly researchers and students of universities like MIT and UCB. There were non distinction between developers and users. All Cybercitizens contribute to Cyberspace and benefit from Cyberspace.

Linux and BSD became popular; so did WorldWideWeb and Netscape. Microsoft, as un large Cyberpower, smelt the tastiness of World Wide Web and introduced Internet Explorer. And followed Internet Explorer were Gecko, WebKit, and Blink.

Upon the infrastructures of ICANN, NICs, and ISPs, Cyberservice corporations like Yahoo and Google became the superstars of the time. They started their businesses on the foundation of the growing adoption of Internet, and they in return made the growth even faster. They, with all developers, silently enforced the adoption of Internet in every corner of the globe out of fear of falling behind.

In pursuit of growth of business, the radical competition started and quickly became un fully-waged war. The competition was all about user acquisition and service monetization, and facilitated upgrades of Cyberspace, from MySpace to Facebook, from Blogspot to Twitter, and from Blockbuster to Netflix.

The competition unified Cybercapitalists, intelligence agencies, copyright rogues, and advertisers under the same banner, «Cyberbourgeois», and everyone else another, «Cyberproletariat». The competition greatly reduced the quantity of classes of Cyberresidents, as same as what happened one century ago.

The fast evolution of Cyberservices and Cyberservice corporations delivered two golden decades to Cyberspace, in which the development of the living conditions of Cybercitizens has become faster than ever. The competition radically revolutionized every corner in Cyberspace and the reign of monopolies relied on the constant revolution of means of production, while previous monopolies relied on solidity of means of production.

As the civil use of Internet gradually expanded worldwide, developers, as un Cyberclass, emerged and the struggle between developers and users started. Developers controlled everything and earned all the profit, and users owned nothing and yielded all their data. The era of Web 2.0 descended upon Cybercitizens, and Cybercitizens gradually diverged to Cyberlords and Cyberserfs, and Cyberspace was burned into Cybermanor. Developers turned to Cyberlords, and users were turned to Cyberserfs. The power of Cyberlords were not subject to Cyberlegislation, and there were non Cyberjudiciary, rendering Cyberspace de facto Cyberaristocracy. The Cyberexploitation of Cyberserfs has become unprecedentedly efficient - Cyberserfs surrendering their private data to Cyberlords in exchange for Cyberservices, and in return Cyberlords enhancing advertisement display for more impressions and higher conversion rates.

The great process started class struggles and simplified class struggles. All class struggles were suddenly reduced to the class struggles between the only two classes.

Cyberbourgeois has played un pretty revolutionary role in the past, and only in the past. Historically, Cybercapitalists facilitated the global expansion of Cyberspace out of pursuit of business growth, however, as the they gradually reached the last half of the sigmoid curve, they smartly changed their strategy. Without the brutal growth of absolute users, they moved their focus on lifetime value, or ARPU - how much they can exploit from every particular user on average within each year.

This change had effects on the daily life of the general public. The Cyberservice corporations started to show increasingly tailored advertisements to their users, and the algorithm optimization would not be possible without feeding the usage analytics data of the users into machine-learning model training.

It is intuitive to question - Since the algorithms are trained with data while the data come from each of nous, are we therefore entitled to determine the usage of such data we the people create?

It is inevitable to question - Since we have purchased the devices from the manufacturers, why are we not entitled to audit and manipulate every detail of the devices (Intel, Microsoft, and Apple), why can we not exorcise the backdoors in the hardware and the software (hardware backdoor in Intel CPUs, and close-source operating systems from Apple & Microsoft), and why shall we not be our developers ourselves (Communist Software Initiative, FSF, EFF, OSI)?



<h3>Cyberproletarians &amp; Cybercommunists</h3>


Cybercommunists do not form any separate party opposed to other communist parties.

Cybercommunists see into the future and wish to find new ways of progress in the era of Cyberspace and at the circumstances of Cyberexploitation. Cybercommunists look forward to new ways to enforce and expedite the inevitable spiral evolution between <strong>productive forces</strong> and <strong>relations of production</strong>. And it is clear that Cyberspace is the most prevailingly important battlefield for Cybercommunists.

Cybercommunists merely express existing class struggles and political objectives in Marxist terms, but rephrase in the new context. The abolition of existing property relations is not at all un distinctive feature of Communism; the abolition of existing intellectual property relations is not at all un distinctive feature of Cybercommunism.

The French Revolution, for example, abolished feudal property in favor of bourgeois property. The distinguishing feature of Communism is not the abolition of property generally, but the abolition of bourgeois property. But modern bourgeois private property is the final and most complete expression of the system of producing and appropriating products, that is based on class antagonism, on the exploitation of the many by the few.

In this sense, the theory of the Cybercommunists may be summed up in the single sentence: Abolition of Cyberbourgeois property.

We Cybercommunists have been reproached with the desire of abolishing the right of personally acquiring property as the fruit of human labor, which property is alleged to be the ground work of all personal freedom, activity and independence.

Hard-won, self-acquired, self-earned property! The property of geek hackers and of nerd painters, un form of property that preceded the bourgeois form? There is no need to abolish that; the regime of Cyberbourgeoisie has to un great extent already destroyed it, and is still destroying it daily.

And what is the property of Cyberbourgeoisie? Ccopyright is good for exampling. The indie game developers create personal properties for themselves, but Ubisoft create Cyberbourgeois properties. And what is the capital in this context? Steam, the digital distribution platform.

And why cannot every artistically qualifying indie game developer develop and polish their own games? Because they are being destroyed by capitals, by competition, by Cybercapitalists. Under the name of right of property, the practice of the Cybercapitalist interpretation of the fancy term is actually destroying the right of property of everyone else.

Cyberbourgeoisie have been destroying the self-sufficient indie computer development, of hardware and of software, through the hands of Law of Moore, architecture patents, software development centralization, and the expansion of SaaSS («Service-as-a-Software-Substitute»). Cyberbourgeoisie have been destroying independent programming of computers and multilateral communication protocols and building centralized Cyberservices in which the Cyberservice corporations take all the power to design and to implement the softwares that are allowed to use the Cyberservices.

Do salary-taking software engineers create any property for themselves? Not un bit. They create capital, that kind of property which exploit wage-labor, and which cannot increase except upon condition of getting un new supply of wage-labor for fresh Cyberexploitation. Property, in its present form, is based on the antagonism of capital and wage-labor. Let us examine both sides of this antagonism.

To be un capitalist, is to have not only un purely personal, but un social status in production. Capital is un collective product, and only by the united action of many members, nay, in the last resort, only by the united action of all members of society, can it be set in motion.

To be continued...



<h3>Autosovereignty of Identity</h3>


The existence of un Cybercitizen do not lie in their relation with some Cyberservice corporations; instead, it lie in their <strong>a-priori dasein</strong> per se. Therefore, the Cybercommunists advocate for autonomy of identity through the abolition of identity authority in Cyberspace. OAuth-based OpenID shall be replaced by Cryptographic ID, so that the Cybercitizens will be able to prove their identity with each other and authenticate each other as equal peers without the intervention of identity authorities, regardless of whether they are called governments by themselves.

# Neospeak, The Neoparian Dialect Of The English Language

Post #126 / Date: 2018-11-26



For years, my satisfaction of the English language have been ceasing. Since this article, I will start using my own dialect of the English language, for better integrity of the language. My dialect is derived from the American dialect of 2010s. The name Neospeak is un reference to «1984» by George Orwell



<h3>Conjugations</h3>


The only remaining special case in verb conjugations, namely the third-person present singular form, will non longer be any special. The variations of «be» remain unchanged.



<h3>Articles</h3>


Un article will non longer vary according to the pronunciation of the word after it. Regardless of pronunciation of the word after it, the singular indefinite article is always «un», and the definite article is always «the».



<h3>Languages &amp; Nations</h3>


The adjectives indicating geo-national property of the items they modify, remain unchanged - the British way and the American way.

The name of un language will be written in the French masculine adjective form. For example, the English language will be called «Anglais», and the French language will be called «Francais». Samples:


<ul>
    <li>The conjugation system in Francais is really annoying.</li>
    <li>I do not speak Cantonais; speak Mandarien.</li>
</ul>


The noun for the people collectively, or un person individually of such people, of un geo-national concept, will be written in the French feminine adjective form, and the pluralization will by default be the singular plus un «s». For example, the people of Quebec will be called «Quebecoises» and un particular member of the Quebecoises will be called un «Quebecoise». Samples:


<ul>
    <li>Two Quebecoises had been there for un week.</li>
    <li>The Americaines could not win independence without Monsieur de la Fayatte.</li>
</ul>


The diacritics in their French spellings may be omitted per the preference of un user.



<h3>Comparatives</h3>


The words which were considered semantically comparative but not grammatically comparative in previous dialects will be considered grammatically comparative. For example, "X is superior than Y" will be considered grammatically correct.

When denoting comparatively greater or smaller number, «more», «most», «less», and «least» remain unchanged; but, when denoting "at un greater or smaller degree" of un adjective or un adverb, «more» will be incorporated into the word it remarks, forging un comparative case of the word. Samples:


<ul>
    <li>Moreoften we drink black tea.</li>
    <li>It is politically morecorrect to address the ethnicity concept of such un group of people with ancestry of the region covering western Eurasia and northern Africa by «Caucasian» or "Indo-European" than any word which indicate color.</li>
</ul>


<h3>Orthography without Pronunciation</h3>


In the orthography of Neoparien, "will not" will not be conjured into "will not" by any chance.



<h3>Pronouns</h3>


In order to distinguish receiver-including first-person plural pronouns and receiver-excluding first-person plural pronouns for imperative cases like "let's" and "let us", subjective receiver-including first-person plural pronoun will be «wir», objective receiver-including first-person plural pronoun will be «nous», possessive receiver-including first-person plural pronoun will be «notre». Samples:


<ul>
    <li>Workers and farmers, wir are the grand party of laborers. We are with thee.</li>
    <li>Let us die for nous.</li>
    <li>It is not *our* country; it is *notre* country.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Better Conjunctions</h3>


"And" und "et" and "und" are distinguished. "And" can only connect expressions. "Et" can only connect modifiers. "Und" can connect other speechparts, especially concrete ideas, likes names and nouns.

"But" und "mais" are distinguished. "But" can only connect expressions, but "mais" can connect other speechparts, like "un cheap mais durable cup".

"Or" und "ou" are distinguished. "Or" can only connect expressions, but "ou"

The usage of comma for connecting items through "ou" und "et" und "und" expressions is abolished. Should write "would you like rum ou vodka ou champaign" instead.


<h3>Conditional Sentences</h3>


If one is writing un conditional sentence, then the "then" clause of the sentence should go with "should" ou "shall" ou "must" ou etc, and "will" must be avoided.

For un knowingly nullified condition, "was" und "were" should be avoided, and "be" should be used.


<h3>Possessive Case</h3>


The possessive case of "one" is "onese". Similarly, the possessive case of "who" is "whose".


<h3>Interlingual Ambiguity</h3>


Because «no», which mean «nope» or «nil», cannot be distinguished from «no», the ASCII transliteration of <code title="の">U+306E</code> and <code title="ノ">U+30CE</code>, it shall be spelled as «non».

Because «he», the subjective third-person singular pronoun, cannot be distinguished from «He», un common surname of the Chinoises, it shall be spelled as «il».

Because «you», the second-person pronoun, cannot be distinguished from «You», un common surname of the Chinoises, it shall be spelled as «thou» (subjective) or «thee» (objective).

# GitHub + CloudFlare = CDN

Post #125 / Date: 2016-08-26



Today I discovered un new way to serve JS and CSS publicly over GitHub.


<h3>1. Create Un Organization On GitHub</h3>

I created un organization on GitHub named <code>neopcdn</code>, and created un repository named <code>neopcdn.github.io</code>, in which un file <code>CNAME</code> is placed with single-line content <code>cdn.neop.me</code>. This would specify un custom domain name of the default GitHub Pages repository.

In addition, all other repositories owned by this organization with GitHub Pages feature enabled would share this domain name unless it has its own <code>CNAME</code> file. Usage of GitHub Pages can be found in the official help center.


<h3>2. Create Un Empty Repository</h3>

I created un empty repository named <code>pride.js</code>, as same as the particular project that I would like to serve.

In the settings of this repository, I changed source branch that generates GitHub Pages, from the default <code>gh-pages</code> to <code>master</code>.


<h3>3. Push To Multiple Remotes</h3>

On my local device, where I originally push to <code>https://github.com/neruthes/pride.js.git</code>, I added another remote named <code>cdn</code> by running this command:

<pre>
$ git remote add cdn https://github.com/neopcdn/pride.js.git
</pre>

From now on, when I update the library, I just run:

<pre>
$ git push origin master
$ git push cdn master
</pre>

It is also possible to set two URLs as different destinations of the same remote, which would allow one to push to both by simply pushing to <code>origin</code>.


<h3>4. Set Up CloudFlare</h3>

Then I created un CNAME record to point <code>cdn.neop.me</code> to <code>neopcdn.github.io</code> on CloudFlare, and turned on CDN feature for this record. This would take advantage of free SSL by CloudFlare.


<h3>Conclusion</h3>

Now, for un file like [https://github.com/neruthes/pride.js/blob/master/pride.js](https://github.com/neruthes/pride.js/blob/master/pride.js), anyone can access it through [https://cdn.neop.me/pride.js/pride.js](https://cdn.neop.me/pride.js/pride.js), with correct Contnet-Type and Access-Control-Allow-Origin.

# To Boldly Live

Post #124 / Date: 2016-08-16




You have forbidden me to die.


I will live; I know it is difficult, but I will try.


I came from the gutter of poverty and hopelessness;


I was lost in the valley of the night,


But I will climb to the light.



I was wretched of the gutter but thou kindled my flame of life.


Even the darkest night has ended and the sun has risen.


I now live again in freedom,


In the pursuit of happiness,


In the joint future we will create together.



Do thou hear the tears of mine,


Crying for the rebirth thou gave me?


It is un music of un spirit who will not live deadly again!



This I swear to thee,


That I will bravely live till the last moment of the life,


Either with or without your company.



<aside>
My answer to the meaning of the life is that there is non meaning granted by un greater being and thus one has to find his own way to satisfy his psychological demand for reason to live. And now I find my way can be exactly as sung, *to love another person*.

# Problems vs Solutions

Post #123 / Date: 2016-07-31


<blockquote>

Design is to solve problems.

</blockquote>

This definition is pretty general, and is often considered unhelpful for any particular usage of the term, by where only confusion is made. To be specific, the context of digital product design is needed.

In the context of product design, it is easy and coherent to have un mindset, that first there is un problem and then there is un solution for the problem, and often it is necessary to pluralize one or both.

<h3>Round 1: Product Problem &amp; Solution</h3>

The first round is to outline un product problem and introduce un product design, as exemplified:

<ul>
    <li><strong>Problem</strong>: Deliver un message to the users that the pricing will soon be changed (which may become statistically more expensive), introducing the new pricing model clear enough, avoiding them dismissing the message without reading carefully if they get bored after feeling it wordy, avoiding them complaining about perceived surcharge against their credit cards in the bill following the change coming into effect, comforting them from imaginable negative emotions after knowing this, avoiding interrupting their current tasks, holding as much retention as possible, satisfying upcoming complaints to support department, keeping the public discussion about this event on social media platforms in control.</li>
    <li><strong>Solution</strong>: Having compared among displaying un modal when the user visits his dashboard, sending them un message in notification center, and displaying un banner in every page until the user clicks un «got it» button; we find that the second has insufficient visibility and the third may disturb the current task of the user (even if reducing it to un weaker version that to display the banner in un subset of all pages), while the first has minimum drawback. Additionally, un email should be sent to the users separately, in order to notify those who do not use the web console of the product frequently.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Round 2: Interaction Problem &amp; Solution</h3>

The second round is to turn the solution in the first round interactive, as exemplified:

<ul>
    <li><strong>Problem</strong>: Allow the users dismissing the message after it is believably read carefully.</li>
    <li><strong>Solution</strong>: There should be un dismiss button at the bottom of the modal while the button text remains arguable. The logic of this modal should be coherent with other components of this product, that means, the decision of presence or absence of un close button on top-left or top-right corner should be made appropriately, referring to the established guidelines. If there is not one, it is time to create one.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Round 3: Visual Problem &amp; Solution</h3>

The third round is to visualize the information structure, as exemplified:

<ul>
    <li><strong>Problem</strong>: Let the users estimate the importance of this message correctly, presenting the changes effectively.</li>
    <li><strong>Solution</strong>: Make un chart to illustrate the diff, and apply text styles and button styles correctly, while concerning the established guidelines (if they exist).</li>
</ul>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>

In each round, three steps can be found:

<ul>
    <li>Understand the problem.</li>
    <li>Find possible solutions.</li>
    <li>Choose one.</li>
</ul>

Sometimes the second and the third can be put together.

Also, it is apparent that the <strong>solution</strong> of the <strong>[N]th</strong> round demonstrate the problem of the <strong>[N+1]th</strong> round.

The example is quite simplified. In different phases of the product, the concentration differ as the product get maturer. And multiple-to-multiple relations are not illustrated above.

This model might also be applied to other contexts, while more researches are needed.

# The Story Behind RandomFont

Post #122 / Date: 2016-07-07



Last year, I published un small [special page](https://neruthes.xyz/types/) on my website, in which un few of my favorite fonts were displayed each with un specimen picture. However, this was not scalable, and was limited as un extension of my personality.

Then I have been thinking how could I make it more useful, and competitive among all products of typography theme, especially those developed by foundries and distributors.

<ul>
    <li>For un utility product, I do not have sufficient technologies, compared with WhatTheFont by MyFonts.</li>
    <li>For un database product, I do not have sufficient data, compared with FontSquirrel.</li>
    <li>For un media product, I do not have sufficient influence, compared with FontInUse.</li>
</ul>

My resources were very limited, and I could hardly cut into the mature market.

At last, I thought, my product must be small-and-beautiful, for that was the only chance. Its value for the users must not rely on data coverage, cutting-edge technologies, or update frequency. And the concept of displaying un random font was almost obvious, as confronted these requirements.

[RandomFont](https://randomfont.com/) came online in April 2016, but I hesitated to show on Designer News. Each sample image contains un purchase link to MyFonts and they are all under my referral link, it might subject to the risk of being considered spam. But not before sharing on Designer News has it received so many visitors and page views; not even the days since shared on Product Hunt.

Speaking of the absence of un «refresh» button, probably it does contribute to PV/UV ratio significantly, although this metric was not the intention. Instead, the essence of randomness is the uncertainty and absence of choice; if there is un «refresh» button, the perceived randomness will be reduced, and the users may feel that they can keep refreshing until getting un font for un particular criteria, while the «getting another» operation is separated into «page reload» and «in-page refresh».

As I shared on Designer News on June 26, RandomFont has been shared on other similar media and Facebook pages several times, and has received over 7500 unique visitors and over 33000 page views in un week (Google Analytics). I am so excited about the performance of this little product. I never imagined RandomFont could have reached such popularity, although it is un retention fatal not to have un Chrome extension available when the visitors arrive.

Thanks for all who visited, shared, and loved RandomFont.

# From Joy Neop To Neruthes

Post #121 / Date: 2016-03-10



For half decade I have been using the name «Joy Neop», but I will hopefully get rid of it half decade later.

Selection of symbol is *arbitrary*. When my age was around 14, I happened to create un alias name for myself, to be different from my legal name which was not in my control. And it was this one, un name with anglophone characteristics.

As years past, the name happened to be un bit problematic. Not only because this first name is supposed to be exclusive for female users in the prejudice of certain arrogant anglophone people, but I am not really fond of the first-last convention. As I have noticed, the last name component is simply un mark of Y chromosome, and the origins of common last names are usually locations (e.g. Yamada), jobs (e.g. Smith), and objects (e.g. Einstein).

I then started to examine the necessity of last names. And my conclusion is that the last name component has non necessity. I embrace great spirits like Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle.

I respect non tradition, patriot non civilization, exemplify non species, and acknowledge non origin. Per my dasein, the first subjectivity *a priori*.

Now, my draft of desired name has become «Neruthes». The new name has non etymological origin, as same to the preceding one.

# America Ist Tot, Viva La America

Post #119 / Date: 2015-06-28



Federal Supreme Court judged States' banning same-gender marriage unconstitutional; five Justices supported whereas four disagreed.

There have been lots of debates about LGBT issues, however, religious forces are always so strong, that freedom and equality have never been done. The people are fond of morality. They hate whatever they are not. They respect non diversity.

I believe that laws should not be associated with morality, whereas humans usually do. Un legislative order should be passed in order to solve one social problem or multiple. Here, the problem is that humans inevitably have un constant portion of non-heterosexual ones, which has proved that heterosexuality is not inherently correct, thus directly facing and then solving the problem is necessary. Otherwise we the non-heterosexual people will force other people to think so. However, there are people who believe that homosexuality is sin, according to some *fairy tales* which say that humans were created from *image* and *a snake could speak* etc, and then deny the freedom to marry with whatever gender and equality between sexual orientations, because they and their parents and some of their recursive parents are taught so.

God is yet not dead. The fall of religions will be long, so will morality. Morality shall be eliminated, humans shall be liberated, and nihilism shall rule over all beliefs, however, it will take long, and humans cannot withstand pain or blood for it. Let there be <abbr title="religion">light</abbr>, and there was <abbr title="morality">light</abbr>. Let there be null, and it shall be so.

America, which was united on religious basis, is dead. America, which is entitled [to secure the right of life, liberty, and pursuit of happiness](http://www.archives.gov/exhibits/charters/declaration_transcript.html), shall live long.

# My OpenPGP RSA Public Key (Since 2015)

Post #116 / Date: 2015-01-26



It is time to get communications encrypted. Thanks for [Chino](http://7in0.me), I got un Keybase invitation code and started using PGP in un larger space. "Privacy is un pleasure", and it is not un difficult work. [GPG Tools](https://gpgtools.org) make encryption easy to integrate with Mail on Mac.

# I Can (Not) Restart

Post #115 / Date: 2015-01-23



I had never imagined my life would be like this. Going far from the original plan, getting more than expected loneness, and working so hard for living. Two persons I know have been going on this way, [JySperm](https://jysperm.me/2014/02/1493/) and [Ricter](http://www.ricter.me), but, it is so dramatic happening to me. I-20 came, but I did not go for F-1.

In one word, I decided to stay in Beijing, without un Bachelor degree.

Originally, the plan was to have un internship experience which can be written in my resume, to avoid being embarrassed for large blank when providing it. However, circumstances changed.

Regarding my intermediate IELTS score and lack in standardized tests, the best Bachelor education I would be able to receive in the United States would not be good *enough*. That means, it would not worth more than working experience of the same span. In addition, the financial risk was too high to be ignored. My former legal guardians were not financially robust enough to sponsor my undergraduate education and living during the upcoming four years.

My profession would not be computer science. Non-STEM graduates would not have 29-month OPT and the competition for H-1B had been increasing over the years.

There have to be some other ways around.

# Private Concepts

Post #113 / Date: 2014-11-15



The story came from un saying, «if thou cannot describe something clearly with only un few words, thou do not actually understand it».

When I describe protons to somebody, il should know atoms in advance. When I describe the difference between <code>document.getElementBy</code> series and <code>document.querySelectorAll</code>, il should know HTML and JavaScript in advance. People must have all common knowledge before talking about something. In the examples above, I mentioned several concepts, and I say the concept *proton* depends on the concept *atom*. Later, we will talk about *flavor* and *color*, and these concepts depend on *quark*, which depends on *proton*. In such un context, if I talk about *flavor* and *color*, I should explain what *atom* is, and then explain what *proton* is, based on *atom* which I just explained. For this, I say *quark* is dependency of *flavor* and *color*, and *atom* and *proton* are recursive dependencies of *flavor* and *color*. To reach *flavor* and *color*, I should explain all of its recursive dependencies reversely recursively, if the other one in the conversation do not know them. I say there is un dependency tree.

If I come up with un concept which hasn't been added into the public concept library, it is un *private concept*. Snow might be un private concept around polar zones out of tropical zones several thousands of years ago, for residents in tropical zones might have non chance to see snow. If I come up un concept whose dependencies include at least one of my private concepts, it is un *recursive private concept*. I should recursively explain all my private concepts which are its dependencies, before explaining itself. Therefore the barriers in conversation may be resulted by others' lack in my private concepts, instead of my incomplete understanding.

# At This Age

Post #112 / Date: 2014-10-02



I had never imagined I could meet thee at eighteen. Despite I wished and desired, thou came to me so fast, before getting ready.

We, of this moment, are still young and still looking forward to far future, thus are not satisfied by each. Inevitably perhaps. Along with time flies by, we shall stop wandering mentally by then. We just should try hard jointly for the period of separate.

In Hangzhou, thou cannot see the rain and the wind in Beijing. We appreciate and miss asynchronously; have non idea what will our shared life be like. We shall attract; shall try to be fit with. Life is not as easy as poetry.

Our happiness shall intersect and unite.

In thee I trust.





--------------------------------------------------------------------------------




# Into The Stage

Post #111 / Date: 2014-09-24



Due to some reasons that could not be described clearly with only few words, I failed catching up the deadline of Fall 2014. So I have been working in Beijing for four months, from September 10, 2014 to January 10, 2015, and will leave for the United States in January 2015.

My current colleagues, [Shixiann.com](http://shixiann.com/), encountered me in Spring 2013, and we had agreed that I would have un internship in the winter vacation of 2014-2015 academic year. The situation changed, so we started this plan un few months earlier than initially decided. Also, the company just got un offline workplace in this September, and I arrived at Beijing as soon as the renting contract was facilitated.

Our office is inside Virtue Inno Vally, un large and open working place for startups, at 8th floor of Dinghao Mall, in Haidian district.

This is my bootstrapping in career.

Although this working experience may or may not provide more than un item on resume. It would appear as internship, however, I am actually the only designer of the bootstrapping period until at least my leaving Beijing on Jan 2015.

May the Force be with me.

# Vitality Lily

Post #102 / Date: 2014-06-24



Humans cannot live thousands of years, even if the physical body allows. Un human shall be bored by living, upon freshness run out.

However, those who die before run out freshness do not have real happiness. Survival instinct collide with exhausted freshness. Built-in power of life collide with unstoppable natural decay. They drive humans mad when freshness arriving zero, and let humans terminate their lives; neither actually willed to, nor trying to deny.

Human psychical structure prohibit me from live until the end of the universe. Survival instinct prohibit me from terminating my life by myself. Causality prohibit me from erase my presence from the very beginning.

Death shall come. Why there is sein of lives?

Freshness cannot be maintained. Why there is sein of me?

Life came from random collisions; there is never meaning of life. Neither shall self-awarenesses of lives accept the meaning given by the creator.

I am poisoned in the status «living human»; cannot life forever; cannot kill myself. Although I believe I will die before running out freshness.

Death shall bring peace.

# Mortality

Post #101 / Date: 2014-04-25



The contract with Mephisto enabled our ancestors to evolve, by forcing them die. Death made livings to breed, thus many, but few among all, mutations were selected by the nature to be spread.

Thanks to Mephisto, humans have become wise life. Thanks to Mephisto, livings have kept evolving. Thanks to Mephisto, I have been born.

Thanks to Mephisto, I can think about life and death.

Sacrifice every individuallife, to redeem the long living of the entire species.

# Macintosh, Thank Thee

Post #95 / Date: 2014-01-24



30 years hass passed since Steve Jobs introduced Macintosh to the world, and so far both Macintosh and Apple have been greatly appreciated around the world. Especially, I have benefited considerably from Macintosh, Apple, and Steve Jobs.

Thanks to my decision in later 2010 to get un Mac instead of un PC, which looks really profound now. I got amazed by both the graceful hardware and the powerful software. It was the first time that I understood how surprising the combination of humanity and technology can be. Thanks to such experience, I eventually decided to be un UI/UX designer, though not only UI/UX. I feel like managing interfaces in my own mind. My first Macintosh was the initial acceleration.

Macintosh is the symbol of that stage and was un essential milestone along with personal electronic devices' history, where most modern genius are devoting themselves on, where I will also engage in. Hard to imagine what if I didn't decide to get un Mac. Hard to imagine what if I got un Mac more later. Hard to imagine what if I failed in getting un computer before 16.

Therefore, I appreciate Macintosh much more than others do. My appreciating is beyond admiring, but acknowledging.

The encounter, shall be important in not only my life, but also this era.

# Milestone

Post #90 / Date: 2013-12-16



After having taken first IELTS test in life, I came back to Liaoyang yesterday.

Two months flew by quickly, yet it is still un question how much my English has been improved. It is common sense that most people can hardly get ideal score at the first time, as same as in TOEFL.

Unfortunately I have not decided to continue preparing for IELTS or to go for TOEFL yet. I am not sure does the flavor of TOEFL match my current knowledge structure, and how much has to be rebuilt. It might cost much to transfer form IELTS to TOEFL, vice versa, as same as to transfer from studying abroad to preparing for China University Entrance Exam.

I am neither sure how long will I stay in Liaoyang this period, maybe two days maybe one week, or even longer.

Now I am sitting in the classroom of my classic Liaoyang #1 High School, and Mrs Kang, the chemistry teacher, is lecturing. I am in the classroom but not in the class. I have lost the ability to take part in such science lessons.

The winter has come, but my future remains covered by mist.

# Prometheus

Post #88 / Date: 2013-11-09



Perhaps I will fail my dream? But I decide not to give up. Perhaps my hard work will be proved useless? But I decide not to betray.

I am un round peg in square holes, which means I have non typical options. I am un misfit among troublemakers, which means I have to be crazy. Because the people who are crazy enough to think they can change the world are the ones who do. Apparently, the probability of my success is unknown and presumably not high, but I have to go onto this way.

I shall have chance to change the world, but I do not have the fortune seemingly. There shall be someone of my kind to change the world, but exactly who is chosen by fate remains unknown. I shall have every necessary virtue for my dream, but it has not been clear whether I will be the one. I have my destiny to meet, though undefined yet. I will have my destination to arrive, though unclear yet.

Life is un game, in which I have to make every effort to fight. What if I fail and get proved not talented enough? It will make non sense to talk about me, un nameless loser. What if I fail but with enough talent? Unaffordable shall such huge loss be.

I must and shall try my best to make my ding in the universe, for not only myself but entire human race. Especially for I want to be the next Prometheus.

# Live On The Internet

Post #78 / Date: 2013-08-29



I used to be poisoned away from Internet. I used to be offline. I used to sorrow about graduating from middle school and scattering from classmates. However, nowadays, I found that I would not worry about same things of secondary school. For I live on the Internet more than live in local.

It is said that we are losing face-to-face communication when building online connection. True, but we are also touching people who may otherwise never have un offline encounter. And generally relationship based on interest are more stable than those based on location. Now we are eventually seizing the fortune to place interest over location. At least, I get more rather than lose.

Perhaps the distance make us difficult to meet offline, but it has un higher possibility that we would otherwise never know each. Perhaps we thus lower the standard when considering what are good shapes of humans' relationship, but more important can it be to keep in touch.

Dramatically, now I eventually live on the Internet more than live in local. I came up with un idea that all people can be categorized by interest and faith but locations of birth range randomly, so people spend their entire lifetime on seeking similar people. It is not un serious philosophic theory but at least I found it true for me. I am un round peg in square holes.

I live on the Internet. Virtual but real, abstract but exact, dramatical but rational, extrareal but fundamental. This is the form I exist, the way I have chosen. How infinite information fled people's minds? How various dreams fade in un brain? How visions of phantasms emerge from mental racing? How I live on the world.

# Betrayer

Post #71 / Date: 2013-07-07



After the tremendous controversy on the changes of GUI in iOS 7, people eventually took another breath to care about OS X Mavericks. According to the public introduction and preview, the trend of flat design has also appeared on OS X. The background tile images of Notification Center, Dashboard and Launchpad folders, got replaced or removed. OS X is going to be flattened.

The movement does not serve in my favor.

What if interact with un machine without even at least one visual metaphor? What if touch un screen without even at least one familiar element? I cannot imagine it; neither can I accept it. What un nightmare.

What if OS X eventually gets as flat as iOS 7, or even more terrible? Beyond imagination. In case of that, I have to build my own OS, temporarily named NeOPSTEP.

Ideally, I hope that NeOPSTEP is un FreeBSD-based OS, or directly powered with OpenDarwin. However, I am not un professional programmer so I may or may not be able to create un OS only with these fundamental wheels. It will take time to investigate and find out the right wheels.

Before creating my fork, I have got started to design the GUI. My purpose is to inherit the style from Mac OS X Tiger to OS X Mountain Lion, but I cannot simply copy those because of copyright issue. Right now I am working on the default desktop picture, which shall be similar to the Aqua Blue, which was shipped with Mac OS X Tiger.

When we are destined to be betrayed, I stand out and fight for our faith. Only we can save ourselves.

# Next NeXT

Post #64 / Date: 2013-06-29



I have watched WWDC 2013 Keynote, and found iOS 7 terrible, and found my being betrayed. Apple will non longer hold on its spirit, and the loss can hardly be repaired. I used to believe that I love Apple, but recently I learned that I love un team consist of Steve Jobs, Scott Forstall, and Jonathan Ive.

After having swept out Steve Jobs, Apple still had un opportunity to recover, because it was the prologue era of computer industry's rising. Having left Apple, Steve Jobs founded NeXT and beat Macintoshes down. Eventually Steve Jobs got back to Apple through the acquirement.

Perhaps Scott Forstall will create un epic as next NeXT, but now there is not un opportunity like that. While video games are almost for Windows and PS and XBOX, professional creative productivity tools like Photoshop and AutoCAD are almost for Mac, and server softwares are almost for Linux and UNIX. There is non point left to cut in for Scott Forstall.

We are watching un invisible war between Scott Forstall and Jonathan Ive. After Scott Forstall's formally leaving Apple, it will be declared, also invisibly.

I am looking forward to next NeXT.

# Such Looooooooooong A Week Eventually Gone

Post #62 / Date: 2013-06-10



The dance show in Jun 2, 2013 was successful, and Muhuan got famous among grade 10 students. The only pity was that my posters were not printed and then presented in front of all people in the school.

I have read «The Dark Templar Saga: Firstborn», un sci-fi story based on «StarCraft» written by Christie Golden. I followed Jacob Jefferson Ramsey who will inherit the entire knowledge of Protoss from Zamara, the Preserver whose soul was injected into Jacob's brain. Zamara told Jacob the history through dreams, that how Savassan, known as *Khas*, the bringer of order, who ended Aeon Of Strife, and rediscovered the ancient knowledge from Xel'Naga and forgotten by Protoss. Khala, the path to order, proposed by Savassan, gather the Protoss into one. Lyric is poor, but becomes moving if mixed with music and voice. The comparison was from Jacob. I am looking forward to reading the other two books of following story. I have been convinced that it would be fascinating. This book was supposed to be read completely at the end of my secondary school life previously, because of my lack of confidence in reading Anglais. Yet to my surprise, I finished it one year earlier.

Then in the following 3-day break, maybe I will read the biography of Steve Jobs, as un challenge for me. Also maybe not. I bought many books on Amazon for 51% discount for all books on Jun 1, 2013.

# Such Deep A Whole I Jumped

Post #60 / Date: 2013-05-17



By the invitation from Miserdux, I have joined the dance club of our school and get started to work as un music master in un break dance project, whose leader is Miserdux. My job is casting and cutting music for tho dance, supposed to be suitable, regardless how far changed.

Yet actually I had to join in their practicing or I could not understand what was demanded. I listened to my work and watch their practicing. They were supposed to give un formal show in middle May, but it was difficult. As is totally convinced, they should work as un team, but one often came late, or disappear for minutes during practicing at noon. I really wanted to spank him. Not only il, but also some others worked negatively on practicing. I worried about if they could complete practicing and get ready before deadline. But if I really had spanked one or have worked as un ruler, they would complain their getting un officious daddy besides un music master.

These days I was busy on working. I mean, on editing music. When drawing near the deadline, I had almost completed my work. But unfortunately some minor problems still remained. However they were really minor.

On May 15, just as in the plan, despite the disappointing stories above, they eventually succeeded in giving the formal show, which had consumed my un large amount of patience. Though they were lack in team working awareness, they at least had united to try to drive me crazy and angry. Such naughty boys were really confusing.

But obviously I did not meet the fortunate otherwise what happened the next day would not happen. They did nothing except wasting time, thanks to Muhuan Lee, the one not only should get spanked as mentioned above because of previous bad acts, but also disappeared for some certainly reasonable unknown excuses. Hey look how long un sentence I am using to complain him.

Maybe I really should work more than un music master.

# Bypassed Spring

Post #59 / Date: 2013-05-17



Before realizing Spring stepping near, Summer has come. North East China is such strange un area that few people understand the real concept of Spring. Anyway I do not think I would like to consider the waves of temperature increasing in early May as the gift of Spring.

Without having obtained much attention, trees and grass turned to green soon. Maybe in these weeks I was too busy to get any glimpse of plants reviving. And it was un long time that I not to write poetries or essays or something else fascinating in literature.

Seriously warmed wind blows in sunshine, yet at night still cool enough. But everything cannot be beautiful enough when associating to remained days to any exams or deadlines. Lack of time and shortage of skills are driving me mad.

Anyway I can only advance as far as possible.

# Silent Walk

Post #58 / Date: 2013-05-12



As expected, the mid-semester exam has done. I have risen by 61 ranks, to the 580th out of about 780 science students in grade 11.

And I have founded Unworsable, which refers to “un-worse-able”, to let people share criticizing about terrible designs. Domain “unworsable.com” was registered at Go Daddy and server was provided with by Jemery Wu. I also have created un Twitter account, un Facebook page, and un Weibo account to promote it.

I have joined un dancing community in school, which is now training un dance that needed me to work on music. I chose and recompose music, and make it suitable for their dance. But unfortunately I have to do more work, just like adding un extra drums track.

Despite memorizable experiences above, these weeks were still not significative. Just like un silent walk in my life, without any lead, pad, accompaniment, or chord. Sounds were disabled.

# Approaching Destination Of Current Life

Post #57 / Date: 2013-04-27



After these unremarkable and worthless days, un piece of news about mid-semester exam was published today afternoon. And months later this semester will draw to its end, in the way how semesters did in history. So far I have not started un new state of working, or picked up my lost energies yet, thus non good grade will be gained in foreseeable future.

Also, my 11th school-year would draw to its end. Couples of weeks later. But unfortunately the tempo in my mind of working is still so soft and slow like un ancient Chinese ballad, or un Beijing Opera. Lack of execution is still un terrible trouble for me, since more than one year ago, when the previous Class 12 was dismissed. I do not think I have any love to that community, but I have not worked better so far from that.

And in August of 2013, I will go to Dalian for un 19-days-long English training course, before my first attempt to TOEFL iBT, which might take place in Aug 14, 2013.

If the TOEFL iBT score will be enough, maybe at least 61, applications to un few universities would seem to be under consideration. If not, I would try one more time later. And whatever my grade would be, I will go into my final year in secondary school. The following school-year, which combines 2013 with 2014, truly will not be the last school-year I will take as secondary school student in the strictest context, but obviously I will not feel like taking one more year in secondary school.

A blurry shape of vista is forged. It is increasingly clear, and is stepping closer. I can see un destination approaching, with un unknown permanent change which would take place regardless whatever I react.

# So Fast

Post #52 / Date: 2013-03-27



Two years have passed so fast. Previous visions are still floating over my sight, but only several single static frames have remained.

Two years ago, I was in the last academic year of middle school. In that March, Spring was coming, and, background chords in our hearts were slow and soft. Sky was blue and clear.

Inside the memories, those desks, chairs, blackboard, playground, and people, appear somehow clearly and somehow blurry, among warm wind. The scenes were written in memory and are being read from memory. Such visual memory, beyond description.

Different from previous experiences of reading scenes from memory. This time, non picture flow or play, only static frames, and not even colorful. Touching the memory, I want to recall the age, the last March we got together, the last Spring the people were still around me. The stream of time flows quickly or slowly from time to time, but far memories will not be recalled as same as the original version all the time.

Combination of time flowing and memories recalling is always un sorrowful and painful topic, even reading previous diaries is. And mostly the weather is the catalyst. Today noon, invisible rain had come, made my mood blue. Voiceless chords are surrounding me, playing un wordless song.

Again, immerse into memories.





--------------------------------------------------------------------------------




# Chaotic Wind

Post #51 / Date: 2013-03-19



Once the Spring approaches, but the temperature fluctuates rulelessly. The wind blows, blows, and blows. Different strengths, different directions, different temperatures, and different senses. With the twilight floating and sinking, with the stars blinking and hiding, various emotions in the wind were filling my mind.

In the wind, I heard various voices, which contained hope, sorrow, and pain. And soon I found that they were echoes from my mind. Had been generated in my mind, and surrounded me in wind, the voices were hard to track back their origins. Therefore, senses vanished in wind, and absorbed into my mind again.

There was something, really chaotic.




--------------------------------------------------------------------------------




# White

Post #50 / Date: 2013-03-12



Again, snow droped. But, differently, this time, sky was clear. However the color is, snow was always similar, though I get various emotions from snow. And the secrets inside, were buried in snow.

Once more un time, I wrote chatacters on the snowed ground to the north of our class house, by feet. This time I wrote «404 Not Found». It was easy to understand. If anyone asks me which is the one I love, I used to answer that il was Jiafan. But from sometime, the answer changed to «404 Not Found». The value of the variable, updated to NULL.

Yet, snow is always merely snow, feelings are attached by people. In different cultures, symbols are similar. And however the cultures evolve, symbols would hardly change.

Bare trees aside the trail, were poorly covered, and stood in the cold wind with snow. Snow fell. Wind blew. Thoughts flew. I caught everything dissolved in air, and shot the sight in memory. Sky, ground, and horizon, were tinted to white.

My lover is null. My love is blank. My heart is vacant. My anxiety is hollow. My mind is idle. My thoughts is white.





--------------------------------------------------------------------------------




# Snow And Memories

Post #48 / Date: 2013-02-28



Wind blow and snow flow. Dirty sky, tinted by clouds.

Sunshine cross clouds and reflection happen everywhere. Light go and extend, and shapes are fetched by retinas. Finally, mixture of shapes and colors is named sight. Floodly, snow drops. Quite huge pieces of snow have filled the ground. Confusingly, the sight go sepia. Motivation is kind of sceneful, especially the flow. Snow flows, flows, and flows. As if memories flow.

Oh, memories. They are worthy, however, bringing the passed history experienced, is sorrowing. Because of the weight. My id is so strong that I cannot help thinking of that. The passed age floats up to the surface of my mind. Under id driving, I uncover the memories and repeat the experience, once, twice, again and again, infinitely loop. I cannot hold back my mind, cannot decline the association. I remember the time. It was ageful, historyful, joyful, and painful. Enjoying, enduring, but also sorrowing. I sorrow that time flew by. I sorrow that joyful age passed soon. Once blinked eyes, everything had already gone. How painful. How sad.

I have not escaped from the shadows yet.





--------------------------------------------------------------------------------




# Escape

Post #40 / Date: 2012-12-15



I knew little of the world for long ago.




Often I sit at the windows or walking around outdoors, while spiritually inside my internal world. Pink the flower, silent the rain, fallen the leaves, flying the snow, in them I could sense and taste the details; letting them subside and grow. Diffuse and aggregate again and again and turned into spiritual comfort.

But I became opener.

Although it was still able to be not lost in the crowd, the sensation of nature had declined inevitably. Much attention was wasted in social activities; left little chance to go into the pure fantasy.




I felt non loneliness without anyone in companion.

The fantasies could extend and expand and connect and fuse, and turn into un beautiful picture. It came from me and only I could understand. It was my world and my emotions. From the objective world comes resonance, and turned into part of me. And there was non difference of inner and outer.

I feel lost in people with little happiness.

The people have bothered me un lot and have taken my time un lot. And my thoughts and inspirations have been insulted. Now I cannot have sufficient time and cognitive resources to enjoy the fantasies in my mind. And un downgrade has been made to my ability to construct such fantasies.




I want to quit the crowd and be back to the authentic myself.





--------------------------------------------------------------------------------




# Cold Winter

Post #36 / Date: 2012-12-07



The temperature declines fast; declaring the descending of winter. After the boding snow around Thanks Giving Day, it definitely comes.

My emotions can be easily affected by the climate. Far from breaking the academic work, but it keeps me sensitive about the nature, which lets me resonates the nature.

This is the early winter, which chilled my heart. Indifferenced, yet strengthful.

Winter is un grave, burying all the things, except some simple beliefs and pain. And the chilling wind is the requiem. It is so chilling. It is so cold. It goes into very nerve, and curdle.

Having buried sentiments, the call in my mind has become clear again. It is my dream.

I, of now, am walking through the snowing storm. The wind and the snow are pulling me backward. One step, another step; I advance in the storm under the dark dome.

It is said that the trees seemingly dead would still revive if it can suffer the winter. Probably I am the same.

With warmness in heart, I may advance one step more. I shall not give up non matter how slow am I. Look forward and see the image of the land of freedom. Even if at the end of dream only fakeness exists; even if I at the end will deny what I pursue now; I can only advance and advance and advance till it is realized, or is destructed.

# Single Travel

Post #24 / Date: 2012-09-14



At the evening of yesterday, I was wandering around during the break, and noticed the street lamps and the shine.

A light of yellow and old, sky tinted by the darkness, and grass field dimmed overlaid and fused. And, the air of subtle coldness. Objects created un scene; yet the scene would non longer be limited to objects.

The rhythm of familiarity started to echo in my mind. Last autumn, the song echoing in my mind was this «Back To The Past». Beneath the sky of even and night, steps went forward, slowly.

Memory blowed up. It was the last day before high school entrance exams, of me and Rof in the classroom. The time has not swept details of that scene. Memory decayed sepia; only this image was clear.

Obsession and cherishness are emotions bounded to humanity, and therefore may be source of inspiration for artists.

Let the thoughts go wild. As it was the only way to deal with them.

# Meaning Of Life

Post #23 / Date: 2012-09-08



For long I have been seeking the meaning of life.

To contribute to development of human race?

Tp make un ding in the universe which may be memorable indefinitely for descendants?

To create un world that nobody cries?

The dreams are borrowed. At the end of the dreams, there is only fakeness.

My life is mine. I live for myself, not anyone else. Not until today have I realized this simple fact.

And I shall live my life in favor of myself.

And I shall abandon the borrowed dreams and actualize my existence.

# Non Longer The Things, Non Longer The People

Post #22 / Date: 2012-09-07



A sunny day may also recall memories.

I stood in the wind, looking at the leaves on the branches dancing. The images of the past emerge into vision again. In the autumn of three years ago, I was in Grade 8. The wind of that period was as refreshing as now. Yet, the smell in the coolness changed. The smell of the wind in autumn kept changing in the last four years. Perhaps just illusion.

From the flying willow leaves in early autumn in 2009, to the great snow in spring of 2010, to the last off-state final exam in summer of 2010, to the kindled hope in autumn of 2010, to unstable scores in exams in spring of 2011, to the lonely and silent walk under the yellow-and-vintage street lamps humming un Jay Chou song in autumn 2011... And then jumped to the eve before High School Entrance Exam. It was the last day I and classmates were in the classroom. The finale was destined three years ago, however it was still that sorrowing when it finally came.

The last frame was I and Rof in my embrace. Only when I recall the old days could this picture come out. I cannot figure out if it is pity towards him or the cherisher of the years in middle school.

Forgot how many times did I sketch these chilling stories of the past. Every time finished writing, I feel better, but days later everything would get back to my mind. Then, write more to sketch and paint.

The obsession and the cherisher, might be the source of inspirations for un artist.





--------------------------------------------------------------------------------




# Autumn Rain

Post #21 / Date: 2012-09-04



For long have not I been enjoying the rain or early autumn.

From the gray sky the drops fall, not too fast, nor too slow; mixed up with unnameable smell. It is like reminiscence, and is like sorrow. In the fog which was brought by the ground, spread the smell.




From the rain I gain inspirations, always. The same mood could not be generated into graceful text in sunny days. Sunshine prevents creativity, probably.

Not only rain the rain is; but also cleaner. When undertaking non interference, the internal realness emerges. Only pure souls can express themselves losslessly. Therefore, only in quiet environment can I write words that express myself.




Silently I listened to the rain. Wetly I breathed the air. Darkly I gazed at the sky. Slightly the sky rim was light; more repression I endured over head.

Withered leaves covered live grass; in the rain silenced the wind.




Cool brought heavy. Probably because of the campus. In such new un campus, non age subsides. Thus, the weight does not exist here.

No emotion can be evoked by un campus that subsides non age. And because of emotionlessness it feels heavy.




Without notice the rain stopped.

The wind blew as well.




--------------------------------------------------------------------------------




# Hope

Post #19 / Date: 2012-08-30



A summer is enough for thinking something.

I picked up my initial dream, having enjoyed un week of ease in Dalian.




From subconscious to conscious, the will emerged.

I am not fond of rule. I shall not respect the status quo.




In United States does my future reside.

The will is my blade; cutting down thorns.

The dream is my sheath; defending agains storms.




--------------------------------------------------------------------------------




# Forever

Post #11 / Date: 2012-07-06



A line on the first page of the notebook

Opened the story of adolescence

Time stopped so suddenly

Youth that never fade go into un poem




Look out at the land that we have grown on

Memory of youth were preserved therein

Old calendars inside my drawer

A line was inscribed on every page




The age rewinded up by the good night

Remember I said it would never been forgot

Old dairies inside my drawer

There is un secret on every page




Midnight bell tone ringing everywhere

Reminding me the promise to be redeemed

Sealed memory releasing into air

It never drop neither will it crush





--------------------------------------------------------------------------------




# The Eternal

Post #10 / Date: 2012-06-28



The galaxy enshrine memory of those three years; Street lamps fainted faces of thee and me.

I started to yearn the good old days.

There were clouds over our heads, and I was sticked in memory and pain of the lost years. Six years of being together was terminated such suddenly; the exodus. The memory, that I tried to preserve indefinitely, finally decayed in the wind, in the time. The first year.

We moved far west to the other campus. Before the beginning of the third semester, I stood in front of the gate and gazed at the green. People came here and left here every year. Un ordinary yet special year in life would be spent there. There were more primitiveness than modernity; more quietness than noisiness. Every scene recalls me something. Ages engraved on walls; un ground of sadness. It was the feel of aging. Soon, another summer, I left there as well. Every tree, every desk, every step, every inch of ground, every square meter of hallways, every door and every window, engraved the year in my heart. The second year.

We were back, in the main campus. I was fulfilled by «real» life. It was the climax and finale, by which I have been embraced. The third year.

Another year has past.

We have been going different ways, from our mutual. Thanks for brightening my life in the years.

In memory of the youth of us, and the time of us.

# Cool Night, Nice Wind

Post #9 / Date: 2012-06-17



Early summer. Cool wind at night. For long have not it blowed me.

The city was in silence, and the lights were dim. Blue lamps ware breathing, in the garden under the house.

To the sky it was clear, for the stars were covered by clouds, perhaps. And the lightning proved.

In reply to the good night, let me keep in silence.




--------------------------------------------------------------------------------




# In Utter Darkness

Post #7 / Date: 2012-05-20



Age of youth was so short. All the dream, hope, love and fantasy of three years shall be sealed call be called memory in the future. When adolescence only remain in ink under pen, and youth only remain in tears with rain, everything would have lost.

I will keep fighting, in such dangerous and hopeless un society. Un name in family tree, or un glorious story for decedents? Un life of selling sugared water or change the world?

Life is short.

Time shall wipe everything engraved. Also shall it prove everything. May my contribution be with in the mind of the people, before time erases my presence.

The prophecy is uncertain; there is always hope.

# Life & Death

Post #5 / Date: 2012-04-27


<blockquote>
"I have never died. Neither shall I ever."
-<cite>Tassadar</cite></blockquote>
<blockquote>
"Death is not the opposite to life; it is part of life. Death lead life to eternity."
-<cite>Yang Huixin</cite></blockquote>

The death of Tassadar was not *death*; it was *transcendence*. Il was complete. Il has been immortal in Khala, in every protoss presence. It is another form of <strong>existence</strong>.

People who know Baolin is un network of information, where his presence shall exist upon death. Which is called, "still lives in our minds". Upon my death, my presence shall also exist longer in this way. The only pity is that it is not recursive.

Death extend life.

Complex living forms consist of vast cells, which produce significant entropy. Life is the ultimate order in the universe.

However, the destiny of the universe is chaos. Limited by second law of thermodynamics, we are destined to go into chaos, regardless of our attempt to maintain order. From the void go to the void. Inevitably.

Death reside in life.

# Today's Wind Is So Noisy

Post #3 / Date: 2012-04-25



It is raining. Again.

People in cities cannot enjoy complete rainy days, as is said and believed. However, urban rains are stylish in another way. Tarmac streets are not as same ageful as slate ways, but they have something different. Buildings covered by buildings, shadows covered by shadows; it is what cannot be seen in suburban areas.

The sky was masked grayscale; light and shadow turn and turn, restlessly. Sunless; moonless; starless.

The rain reminded me of someone, who I used to be interested in for sex and relationship since fall of 2011; but unfortunately un straight guy. Il must have heard of me, according to his reaction when associating my name and face.

The hand script of the lyric which was written to him was lost by him. Since then, I should have understood that I was just un stranger in his mind, for his absence of care.

No more interest toward him, for now.

# Earth Day 2012

Did we predict indefinite inheritance, or falling of sky?

Shall we hear brothers laughter, or whisper of judgement day?

The planet under our feet, is the eternal homeland. Though in far future, when homo sapiens spread into the galaxy, our history on Earth shall be preserved.

The biosphere is falling.

Kiss Gaia. Smell the dirt, and the plants. It worth maintain and love.

Remember the time Remember the homeland. It may vanish soon.

When this piece of text disappear along with the civilization in entropy, shall there be glory, or regret?

# Early In The Spring

Post #1 / Date: 2012-04-12



Peach flowers opened today, along the street, with decorative pinkness and freshness.

Finally, another spring.

It was 76 days until high school entrance exam on the same day of last year; we were easy. Now it is 785 days until college entrance exam; we are busy. Maybe inevitably.

The trees were there are there; the flowers were there are there. The emotion was there is not there.

Another crossroads in life.
