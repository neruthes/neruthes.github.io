<p>At the evening of yesterday, I was wandering around during the break, and noticed the street lamps and the shine.</p>
<p>A light of yellow and old, sky tinted by the darkness, and grass field dimmed overlaid and fused. And, the air of subtle coldness. Objects created un scene; yet the scene would non longer be limited to objects.</p>
<p>The rhythm of familiarity started to echo in my mind. Last autumn, the song echoing in my mind was this «Back To The Past». Beneath the sky of even and night, steps went forward, slowly.</p>
<p>Memory blowed up. It was the last day before high school entrance exams, of me and Rof in the classroom. The time has not swept details of that scene. Memory decayed sepia; only this image was clear.</p>
<p>Obsession and cherishness are emotions bounded to humanity, and therefore may be source of inspiration for artists.</p>
<p>Let the thoughts go wild. As it was the only way to deal with them.</p>
