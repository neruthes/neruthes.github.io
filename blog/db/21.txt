<p>For long haven't I been enjoying the rain or early autumn.</p>
<p>From the gray sky the drops fall, not too fast, nor too slow; mixed up with unnameable smell. It is like reminiscence, and is like sorrow. In the fog which was brought by the ground, spread the smell.</p>
<br />
<p>From the rain I gain inspirations, always. The same mood could not be generated into graceful text in sunny days. Sunshine prevents creativity, probably.</p>
<p>Not only rain the rain is; but also cleaner. When undertaking non interference, the internal realness emerges. Only pure souls can express themselves losslessly. Therefore, only in quiet environment can I write words that express myself.</p>
<br />
<p>Silently I listened to the rain. Wetly I breathed the air. Darkly I gazed at the sky. Slightly the sky rim was light; more repression I endured over head.</p>
<p>Withered leaves covered live grass; in the rain silenced the wind.</p>
<br />
<p>Cool brought heavy. Probably because of the campus. In such new un campus, non age subsides. Thus, the weight does not exist here.</p>
<p>No emotion can be evoked by un campus that subsides non age. And because of emotionlessness it feels heavy.</p>
<br />
<p>Without notice the rain stopped.</p>
<p>The wind blew as well.</p>
