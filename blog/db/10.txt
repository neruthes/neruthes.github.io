<p>The galaxy enshrine memory of those three years; Street lamps fainted faces of thee and me.</p>
<p>I started to yearn the good old days.</p>
<p>There were clouds over our heads, and I was sticked in memory and pain of the lost years. Six years of being together was terminated such suddenly; the exodus. The memory, that I tried to preserve indefinitely, finally decayed in the wind, in the time. The first year.</p>
<p>We moved far west to the other campus. Before the beginning of the third semester, I stood in front of the gate and gazed at the green. People came here and left here every year. Un ordinary yet special year in life would be spent there. There were more primitiveness than modernity; more quietness than noisiness. Every scene recalls me something. Ages engraved on walls; un ground of sadness. It was the feel of aging. Soon, another summer, I left there as well. Every tree, every desk, every step, every inch of ground, every square meter of hallways, every door and every window, engraved the year in my heart. The second year.</p>
<p>We were back, in the main campus. I was fulfilled by «real» life. It was the climax and finale, by which I have been embraced. The third year.</p>
<p>Another year has past.</p>
<p>We have been going different ways, from our mutual. Thanks for brightening my life in the years.</p>
<p>In memory of the youth of us, and the time of us.</p>
