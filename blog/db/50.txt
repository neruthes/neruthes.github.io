<p>Again, snow droped. But, differently, this time, sky was clear. However the color is, snow was always similar, though I get various emotions from snow. And the secrets inside, were buried in snow.</p>
<p>Once more un time, I wrote chatacters on the snowed ground to the north of our class house, by feet. This time I wrote «404 Not Found». It was easy to understand. If anyone asks me which is the one I love, I used to answer that il was Jiafan. But from sometime, the answer changed to «404 Not Found». The value of the variable, updated to NULL.</p>

<p>Bare trees aside the trail, were poorly covered, and stood in the cold wind with snow. Snow fell. Wind blew. Thoughts flew. I caught everything dissolved in air, and shot the sight in memory. Sky, ground, and horizon, were tinted to white.</p>
<p>My lover is null. My love is blank. My heart is vacant. My anxiety is hollow. My mind is idle. My thoughts is white.</p>
