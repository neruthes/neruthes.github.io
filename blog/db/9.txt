<p>Early summer. Cool wind at night. For long haven't it blowed me.</p>
<p>The city was in silence, and the lights were dim. Blue lamps ware breathing, in the garden under the house.</p>
<p>To the sky it was clear, for the stars were covered by clouds, perhaps. And the lightning proved.</p>
<p>In reply to the good night, let me keep in silence.</p>
