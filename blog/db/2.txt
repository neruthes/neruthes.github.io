<p>Did we predict indefinite inheritance, or falling of sky?</p>
<p>Shall we hear brothers' laughter, or whisper of judgement day?</p>
<p>The planet under our feet, is the eternal homeland. Though in far future, when homo sapiens spread into the galaxy, our history on Earth shall be preserved.</p>
<p>The biosphere is falling.</p>
<p>Kiss Gaia. Smell the dirt, and the plants. It worth maintain and love.</p>
<p>Remember the time Remember the homeland. It may vanish soon.</p>
<p>When this piece of text disappear along with the civilization in entropy, shall there be glory, or regret?</p>
