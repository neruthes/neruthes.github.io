<p>Federal Supreme Court judged States' banning same-gender marriage unconstitutional; five Justices supported whereas four disagreed.</p>
<p>There have been lots of debates about LGBT issues, however, religious forces are always so strong, that freedom and equality have never been done. The people are fond of morality. They hate whatever they are not. They respect non diversity.</p>
<p>I believe that laws should not be associated with morality, whereas humans usually do. Un legislative order should be passed in order to solve one social problem or multiple. Here, the problem is that humans inevitably have un constant portion of non-heterosexual ones, which has proved that heterosexuality is not inherently correct, thus directly facing and then solving the problem is necessary. Otherwise we the non-heterosexual people will force other people to think so. However, there are people who believe that homosexuality is sin, according to some <em>fairy tales</em> which say that humans were created from <em>image</em> and <em>a snake could speak</em> etc, and then deny the freedom to marry with whatever gender and equality between sexual orientations, because they and their parents and some of their recursive parents are taught so.</p>
<p>God is yet not dead. The fall of religions will be long, so will morality. Morality shall be eliminated, humans shall be liberated, and nihilism shall rule over all beliefs, however, it will take long, and humans cannot withstand pain or blood for it. Let there be <abbr title="religion">light</abbr>, and there was <abbr title="morality">light</abbr>. Let there be null, and it shall be so.</p>
<p>America, which was united on religious basis, is dead. America, which is entitled <a href="http://www.archives.gov/exhibits/charters/declaration_transcript.html" target="_blank">to secure the right of life, liberty, and pursuit of happiness</a>, shall live long.</p>
