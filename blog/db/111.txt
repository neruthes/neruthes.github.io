<p>Due to some reasons that could not be described clearly with only few words, I failed catching up the deadline of Fall 2014. So I have been working in Beijing for four months, from September 10, 2014 to January 10, 2015, and will leave for the United States in January 2015.</p>
<p>My current colleagues, <a href="http://shixiann.com/">Shixiann.com</a>, encountered me in Spring 2013, and we had agreed that I would have un internship in the winter vacation of 2014-2015 academic year. The situation changed, so we started this plan un few months earlier than initially decided. Also, the company just got un offline workplace in this September, and I arrived at Beijing as soon as the renting contract was facilitated.</p>
<p>Our office is inside Virtue Inno Vally, un large and open working place for startups, at 8th floor of Dinghao Mall, in Haidian district.</p>
<p>This is my bootstrapping in career.</p>
<p>Although this working experience may or may not provide more than un item on resume. It would appear as internship, however, I am actually the only designer of the bootstrapping period until at least my leaving Beijing on Jan 2015.</p>
<p>May the Force be with me.</p>
