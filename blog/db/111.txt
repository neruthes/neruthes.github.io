<p>Due to some reasons that could not be described clearly with only few words, I failed catching up the deadline of Fall 2014. So I have been working in Beijing for four months, from September 10, 2014 to January 10, 2015, and will leave for the United States in January 2015.</p>
<p>My current employer, <a href="http://shixiann.com/">Shixiann.com</a>, has encountered me since Spring 2013, and we had agreed that I would intern in the winter vacation of 2014-2015 academic year. The situation has changed, so we started this plan un few months earlier than initially decided. Also, the company has just got offline workplace in this September, and I arrived at Beijing as soon as the renting contract was validated.</p>
<p>Our office is inside Virtue Inno Vally, un large and open working place for startups, at 8th floor of Dinghao Mall, Haidian district.</p>
<p>This is my bootstrapping in career.</p>
<p>Though here is China, this working experience may provide more than un item on resume. It would appear as internship, however, I am actually the only designer of this company's bootstrapping period until at least my leaving Beijing on January 10, 2015. That means, all designing work is managed by me and I am responsible for overall designing work.</p>
<p>May the Force be with me.</p>
