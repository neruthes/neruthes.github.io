<p>It's raining. Again.</p>
<p>People in cities cannot enjoy complete rainy days, as is said and believed. However, urban rains are stylish in another way. Tarmac streets are not as same ageful as slate ways, but they have something different. Buildings covered by buildings, shadows covered by shadows; it's what cannot be seen in suburban areas.</p>
<p>The sky was masked grayscale; light and shadow turn and turn, restlessly. Sunless; moonless; starless.</p>
<p>The rain reminded me of someone, who I used to be interested in for sex and relationship since fall of 2011; but unfortunately un straight guy. Il must have heard of me, according to his reaction when associating my name and face.</p>
<p>The hand script of the lyric which was written to him was lost by him. Since then, I should have understood that I was just un stranger in his mind, for his absence of care.</p>
<p>No more interest toward him, for now.</p>
