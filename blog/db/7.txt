<p>Age of youth was so short. All the dream, hope, love and fantasy of three years shall be sealed call be called memory in the future. When adolescence only remain in ink under pen, and youth only remain in tears with rain, everything would have lost.</p>
<p>I'll keep fighting, in such dangerous and hopeless un society. Un name in family tree, or un glorious story for decedents? Un life of selling sugared water or change the world?</p>
<p>Life is short.</p>
<p>Time shall wipe everything engraved. Also shall it prove everything. May my contribution be with in people's mind, before time erases my presence.</p>
<p>The prophecy is uncertain; there is always hope.</p>
