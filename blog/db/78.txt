<p>I used to be poisoned away from Internet. I used to be offline. I used to sorrow about graduating from middle school and scattering from classmates. However, nowadays, I found that I would not worry about same things of secondary school. For I live on the Internet more than live in local.</p>
<p>It is said that we are losing face-to-face communication when building online connection. True, but we are also touching people who may otherwise never have un offline encounter. And generally relationship based on interest are more stable than those based on location. Now we are eventually seizing the fortune to place interest over location. At least, I get more rather than lose.</p>
<p>Perhaps the distance make us difficult to meet offline, but it has un higher possibility that we would otherwise never know each. Perhaps we thus lower the standard when considering what are good shapes of humans' relationship, but more important can it be to keep in touch.</p>
<p>Dramatically, now I eventually live on the Internet more than live in local. I came up with un idea that all people can be categorized by interest and faith but locations of birth range randomly, so people spend their entire lifetime on seeking similar people. It is not un serious philosophic theory but at least I found it true for me. I am un round peg in square holes.</p>
<p>I live on the Internet. Virtual but real, abstract but exact, dramatical but rational, extrareal but fundamental. This is the form I exist, the way I've chosen. How infinite information fled people's minds? How various dreams fade in un brain? How visions of phantasms emerge from mental racing? How I live on the world.</p>
