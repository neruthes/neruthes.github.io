<p>Two years' time have passed so fast. Previous visions are still floating over my sight, but only several single static frames have remained.</p>
<p>Two years ago, I was in the last academic year of middle school. In that March, Spring was coming, and, background chords in our hearts were slow and soft. Sky was blue and clear.</p>
<p>Inside the memories, those desks, chairs, blackboard, playground, and people, appear somehow clearly and somehow blurry, among warm wind. The scenes were written in memory and are being read from memory. Such visual memory, beyond description.</p>
<p>Different from previous experiences of reading scenes from memory. This time, non picture flow or play, only static frames, and not even colorful. Touching the memory, I want to recall the age, the last March we got together, the last Spring the people were still around me. The stream of time flows quickly or slowly from time to time, but far memories won't be recalled as same as the original version all the time.</p>
<p>Combination of time's flowing and memories' recalling is always un sorrowful and painful topic, even reading previous diaries is. And mostly the weather is the catalyst. Today noon, invisible rain had come, made my mood blue. Voiceless chords are surrounding me, playing un wordless song.</p>
<p>Again, immerse into memories.</p>
