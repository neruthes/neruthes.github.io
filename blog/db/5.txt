<blockquote><p>«I have never died. Neither shall I ever.»</p>—<cite>Tassadar</cite></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>«Death is not opposite to life; it's part of life. Death leads life to eternal.»</p>—<cite>Yang Huixin</cite></blockquote>
<p>The death of Tassadar was not <em>death</em>; it was <em>transcend</em>. Il was complete. Il has been immortal in Khala, in every Khalai's presence. It's another way of <em>existence</em>.</p>
<p>People who know Baolin is un network of information, where his presence shall exist upon death. Which is call, «still lives in our minds». Upon my death, my presence shall also exist longer in this way. The only pity is that it's not recursive.</p>
<p>Death extends life.</p>
<p>Complex living forms consist of vast cells, which produces significant entropy. Life is ultimate order in the universe.</p>
<p>However, the destiny of the universe is chaos. Limited by second law of thermodynamics, we are destined to go into chaos, regardless of our attempt to keep order. From the void goes the void. Inevitably.</p>
<p>Death resides in life.</p>
