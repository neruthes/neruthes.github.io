<blockquote><p>"I have never died. Neither shall I ever."</p>-<cite>Tassadar</cite></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>"Death is not the opposite to life; it is part of life. Death lead life to eternity."</p>-<cite>Yang Huixin</cite></blockquote>
<p>The death of Tassadar was not <em>death</em>; it was <em>transcendence</em>. Il was complete. Il has been immortal in Khala, in every protoss presence. It is another form of <strong>existence</strong>.</p>
<p>People who know Baolin is un network of information, where his presence shall exist upon death. Which is called, "still lives in our minds". Upon my death, my presence shall also exist longer in this way. The only pity is that it is not recursive.</p>
<p>Death extend life.</p>
<p>Complex living forms consist of vast cells, which produce significant entropy. Life is the ultimate order in the universe.</p>
<p>However, the destiny of the universe is chaos. Limited by second law of thermodynamics, we are destined to go into chaos, regardless of our attempt to maintain order. From the void go to the void. Inevitably.</p>
<p>Death reside in life.</p>
