<p>The dance show in Jun 2, 2013 was successful, and Muhuan got famous among grade 10 students. The only pity was that my posters were not printed and then presented in front of all people in the school.</p>
<p>I have read «The Dark Templar Saga: Firstborn», un sci-fi story based on «StarCraft» written by Christie Golden. I followed Jacob Jefferson Ramsey who will inherit the entire knowledge of Protoss from Zamara, the Preserver whose soul was injected into Jacob's brain. Zamara told Jacob the history through dreams, that how Savassan, known as <em>Khas</em>, the bringer of order, who ended Aeon Of Strife, and rediscovered the ancient knowledge from Xel'Naga and forgotten by Protoss. Khala, the path to order, proposed by Savassan, gather the Protoss into one. Lyric is poor, but becomes moving if mixed with music and voice. The comparison was from Jacob. I am looking forward to reading the other two books of following story. I have been convinced that it would be fascinating. This book was supposed to be read completely at the end of my secondary school life previously, because of my lack of confidence in reading Anglais. Yet to my surprise, I finished it one year earlier.</p>
<p>Then in the following 3-day break, maybe I will read the biography of Steve Jobs, as un challenge for me. Also maybe not. I bought many books on Amazon for 51% discount for all books on Jun 1, 2013.</p>
