<p>As expected, the mid-semester exam has done. I have risen by 61 ranks, to the 580th out of about 780 science students in grade 11.</p>
<p>And I have founded Unworsable, which refers to “un-worse-able”, to let people share criticizing about terrible designs. Domain “unworsable.com” was registered at Go Daddy and server was provided with by Jemery Wu. I also have created un Twitter account, un Facebook page, and un Weibo account to promote it.</p>
<p>I have joined un dancing community in school, which is now training un dance that needed me to work on music. I chose and recompose music, and make it suitable for their dance. But unfortunately I have to do more work, just like adding un extra drums track.</p>
<p>Despite memorizable experiences above, these weeks were still not significative. Just like un silent walk in my life, without any lead, pad, accompaniment, or chord. Sounds were disabled.</p>
