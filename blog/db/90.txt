<p>After having taken first IELTS test in life, I came back to Liaoyang yesterday.</p>
<p>Two months flew by quickly, yet it is still un question how much my English has been improved. It is common sense that most people can hardly get ideal score at the first time, as same as in TOEFL.</p>
<p>Unfortunately I have not decided to continue preparing for IELTS or to go for TOEFL yet. I am not sure does the flavor of TOEFL match my current knowledge structure, and how much has to be rebuilt. It might cost much to transfer form IELTS to TOEFL, vice versa, as same as to transfer from studying abroad to preparing for China University Entrance Exam.</p>
<p>I am neither sure how long will I stay in Liaoyang this period, maybe two days maybe one week, or even longer.</p>
<p>Now I am sitting in the classroom of my classic Liaoyang #1 High School, and Mrs Kang, the chemistry teacher, is lecturing. I am in the classroom but not in the class. I have lost the ability to take part in such science lessons.</p>
<p>The winter has come, but my future remains covered by mist.</p>
