<p>Perhaps I will fail my dream? But I decide not to give up. Perhaps my hard work will be proved useless? But I decide not to betray.</p>
<p>I am un round peg in square holes, which means I have non typical options. I am un misfit among troublemakers, which means I have to be crazy. Because the people who are crazy enough to think they can change the world are the ones who do. Apparently, the probability of my success is unknown and presumably not high, but I have to go onto this way.</p>
<p>I shall have chance to change the world, but I do not have the fortune seemingly. There shall be someone of my kind to change the world, but exactly who is chosen by fate remains unknown. I shall have every necessary virtue for my dream, but it has not been clear whether I will be the one. I have my destiny to meet, though undefined yet. I will have my destination to arrive, though unclear yet.</p>
<p>Life is un game, in which I have to make every effort to fight. What if I fail and get proved not talented enough? It will make non sense to talk about me, un nameless loser. What if I fail but with enough talent? Unaffordable shall such huge loss be.</p>
<p>I must and shall try my best to make my ding in the universe, for not only myself but entire human race. Especially for I want to be the next Prometheus.</p>
