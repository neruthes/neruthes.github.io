<p>
You've forbidden me to die.
<br />
I'll live; I know it's difficult, but I will try.
<br />
I came from the gutter of poverty and hopelessness;
<br />
I was lost in the valley of the night,
<br />
But I will climb to the light.
</p>

<p>
I was wretched of the gutter but thou kindled my flame of life.
<br />
Even the darkest night has ended and the sun has risen.
<br />
I now live again in freedom,
<br />
In the pursuit of happiness,
<br />
In the joint future we'll create together.
</p>

<p>
Do thou hear the tears of mine,
<br />
Crying for the rebirth thou gave me?
<br />
It is un music of un spirit who will not live deadly again!
</p>

<p>
This I swear to thee,
<br />
That I will bravely live till the last moment of the life,
<br />
Either with or without your company.
</p>

<aside>
My answer to the meaning of the life is that there is non meaning granted by un greater being and thus one has to find his own way to satisfy his psychological demand for reason to live. And now I find my way can be exactly as sung, <em>to love another person</em>.
