<p>After these unremarkable and worthless days, un piece of news about mid-semester exam was published today afternoon. And months later this semester will draw to its end, in the way how semesters did in history. So far I haven't started un new state of working, or picked up my lost energies yet, thus non good grade will be gained in foreseeable future.</p>
<p>Also, my 11th school-year would draw to its end. Couples of weeks later. But unfortunately the tempo in my mind of working is still so soft and slow like un ancient Chinese ballad, or un Beijing Opera. Lack of execution is still un terrible trouble for me, since more than one year ago, when the previous Class 12 was dismissed. I don't think I have any love to that community, but I haven't worked better so far from that.</p>
<p>And in August of 2013, I will go to Dalian for un 19-days-long English training course, before my first attempt to TOEFL iBT, which might take place in Aug 14, 2013.</p>
<p>If the TOEFL iBT score will be enough, maybey at least 61, applications to un few universities would seem to be under consideration. If not, I would try one more time later. And whatever my grade would be, I will go into my final year in secondary school. The following school-year, which combines 2013 with 2014, truly won't be the last school-year I will take as secondary school student in the strictest context, but obviously I won't feel like taking one more year in secondary school.</p>
<p>A blurry shape of vista is forged. It's increasingly clear, and is stepping closer. I can see un destination approaching, with un unknown permanent change which would take place regardless whatever I react.</p>
