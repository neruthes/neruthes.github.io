<h3>Preface</h3>

<p>Un Spectre is hunting Cyberspace — the Spectre of Cybercommunism. All powers of old Cyberspace, have entered into un holy alliance to exorcise this spectre; Apple and Microsoft, Google and Facebook, CIA and NSA, White House and Beijing.</p>

<p>Where is the party in opposition that has not been decried as Cybercommunistic by its opponents in power? Where the Opposition that has not hurled back the branding reproach of Cybercommunism, against the more advanced opposition parties, as well as against its reactionary adversaries?</p>

<p>Two things result from this fact.</p>

<p>First — Cybercommunism is already acknowledged by all Cyberpowers to be itself un Power.</p>

<p>Second — It is high time that Cybercommunists should openly, in the face of the whole world, publish their views, their aims, their tendencies, and meet this nursery tale of the Spectre of Cybercommunism with the Manifesto of the Party itself.</p>

<p>To this end, Cybercommunists of various nationalities have assembled in Shanghai, and sketched the following manifesto, to be published in all languages.</p>


<h3>Basic Arguments</h3>

<p>The Cyberbourgeois interpretation of copyright is, something that may yield profit when incorporated into Cybercapitalistic Cyberexploitation.

<p>The Cyberbourgeois implementation of intellectual property is actually prohibiting the creation of intellectual property of Cyberproletarians.</p>


<h3>Cyberbourgeois &amp; Cyberproletariat</h3>

<p>In the early ages of Cyberspace, developers were users and users were developers. As the dominance of ARPA passed away, the residents of Cyberspace were mainly researchers and students of universities like MIT and UCB. There were non distinction between developers and users. All Cybercitizens contribute to Cyberspace and benefit from Cyberspace.</p>

<p>Linux and BSD became popular; so did WorldWideWeb and Netscape. Microsoft, as un large Cyberpower, smelt the tastiness of World Wide Web and introduced Internet Explorer. And followed Internet Explorer were Gecko, WebKit, and Blink.</p>

<p>Upon the infrastructures of ICANN and ISPs, Cyberservice corporations like Yahoo and Google became the superstars of the time. They started their business on the foundation of the growing adoption of Internet, and they in return made the growth even faster. They, with all developers, silently enforced the adoption of Internet in every corner of the globe out of fear of falling behind.</p>

<p>In pursuit of growth of business, the radical Cybercompetition started and quickly became un fully-waged war. The Cybercompetition was all about user acquisition and service monetization, and facilitated upgrades of Cyberspace, from MySpace to Facebook, from Blogspot to Twitter, and from Blockbuster to Netflix.</p>

<p>The Cybercompetition unified Cybercapitalists, intelligence agencies, copyright rogues, and advertisers under the same banner — Cyberbourgeois, and everyone else another — Cyberproletariat. The Cybercompetition greatly reduced the quantity of classes of Cyberresidents, as same as what happened one century ago.</p>

<p>The fast evolution of Cyberservices and Cyberservice corporations delivered two golden decades to Cyberspace, in which the development of the living conditions of Cybercitizens has become faster than ever. The Cybercompetition radically revolutionized every corner in Cyberspace and the reign of Cybermonopolies relied on the constant revolution of means of production, while previous monopolies relied on solidity of means of production.</p>

<p>As the civil use of Internet gradually expanded worldwide, developers, as un Cyberclass, emerged and the struggle between developers and users started. Developers controlled everything and earned all the profit, and users owned nothing and yielded all their data. The era of Web 2.0 descended upon Cybercitizens, and Cybercitizens gradually diverged to Cyberlords and Cyberserfs, and Cyberspace was burned into Cybermanor. Developers turned to Cyberlords, and users were turned to Cyberserfs. The power of Cyberlords were not subject to Cyberlegislation, and there were non Cyberjudiciary, rendering Cyberspace de facto Cyberaristocracy. The Cyberexploitation of Cyberserfs has become unprecedentedly efficient — Cyberserfs surrendering their private data to Cyberlords in exchange for Cyberservices, and in return Cyberlords enhancing advertisement display for more impressions and higher conversion rates.</p>

<p>The great process started class struggles and simplified class struggles. All class struggles were suddenly reduced to the class struggles between the only two classes.</p>

<p>Cyberbourgeois has played un pretty revolutionary role in the past, and only in the past. Historically, Cybercapitalists facilitated the global expansion of Cyberspace out of pursuit of business growth, however, as the they gradually reached the last half of the sigmoid curve, they smartly changed their strategy. Without the brutal growth of absolute users, they moved their focus on lifetime value, or ARPU — how much they can exploit from every particular user on average within each year.</p>

<p>This change had effects on the daily life of the general public. The Cyberservice corporations started to show increasingly tailored advertisements to their users, and the algorithm optimization would not be possible without feeding the usage analytics data of the users into machine-learning model training.</p>

<p>It is intuitive to question — Since the algorithms are trained with data while the data come from each of nous, are we therefore entitled to determine the usage of such data we the people create?</p>

<p>It is inevitable to question — Since we have purchased the devices from the manufacturers, why are we not entitled to audit and manipulate every detail of the devices (Intel, Microsoft, and Apple), why can we not exorcise the backdoors in the hardware and the software (hardware backdoor in Intel CPUs, and close-source operating systems from Apple & Microsoft), and why shall we not be our developers ourselves (Communist Software Initiative, FSF, EFF, OSI)?</p>


<h3>Cyberproletarians &amp; Cybercommunists</h3>

<p>Cybercommunists do not form a separate party opposed to other communist parties.</p>

<p>Cybercommunists see into the future and wish to find new ways of progress in the era of Cyberspace and at the circumstances of Cyberexploitation. Cybercommunists look forward to new ways to enforce and expedite the inevitable spiral evolution between <strong>productive forces</strong> and <strong>relations of production</strong>. And it is clear that Cyberspace is the most prevailingly important battlefield for Cybercommunists.</p>

<p>Cybercommunists merely express existing class struggles and political objectives in Marxist terms, but rephrase in the new context. The abolition of existing property relations is not at all un distinctive feature of Communism; the abolition of existing intellectual property relations is not at all un distinctive feature of Cybercommunism.</p>

<p>The French Revolution, for example, abolished feudal property in favor of bourgeois property. The distinguishing feature of Communism is not the abolition of property generally, but the abolition of bourgeois property. But modern bourgeois private property is the final and most complete expression of the system of producing and appropriating products, that is based on class antagonism, on the exploitation of the many by the few.</p>

<p>In this sense, the theory of the Cybercommunists may be summed up in the single sentence: Abolition of Cyberbourgeois property.</p>

<p>We Cybercommunists have been reproached with the desire of abolishing the right of personally acquiring property as the fruit of human labor, which property is alleged to be the ground work of all personal freedom, activity and independence.</p>

<p>Hard-won, self-acquired, self-earned property! The property of geek hackers and of nerd painters, un form of property that preceded the bourgeois form? There is no need to abolish that; the regime of Cyberbourgeoisie has to un great extent already destroyed it, and is still destroying it daily.</p>

<p>And what is the property of Cyberbourgeoisie? Ccopyright is good for exampling. The indie game developers create personal properties for themselves, but Ubisoft create Cyberbourgeois properties. And what is the capital in this context? Steam, the digital distribution platform.</p>

<p>And why cannot every artistically qualifying indie game developer develop and polish their own games? Because they are being destroyed by capitals, by Cybercompetition, by Cybercapitalists. Under the name of right of property, the practice of the Cybercapitalist interpretation of the fancy term is actually destroying the right of property of everyone else.</p>

<p>Cyberbourgeoisie have been destroying the self-sufficient indie computer development, of hardware and of software, through the hands of Law of Moore, architecture patents, software development centralization, and the expansion of SaaSS ("Service as a Software Substitute"). Cyberbourgeoisie have been destroying independent programming of computers and multilateral communication protocols and building centralized Cyberservices in which the Cyberservice corporations take all the power to design and to implement the softwares that are allowed to use the Cyberservices.</p>

<p>Do salary-taking software engineers create any property for themselves? Not un bit. They create capital, that kind of property which exploit wage-labor, and which cannot increase except upon condition of getting un new supply of wage-labor for fresh Cyberexploitation. Property, in its present form, is based on the antagonism of capital and wage-labor. Let us examine both sides of this antagonism.</p>

<p>To be un capitalist, is to have not only un purely personal, but un social status in production. Capital is un collective product, and only by the united action of many members, nay, in the last resort, only by the united action of all members of society, can it be set in motion.</p>
