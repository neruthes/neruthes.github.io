<p>30 years hass passed since Steve Jobs introduced Macintosh to the world, and so far both Macintosh and Apple have been greatly appreciated around the world. Especially, I have benefited considerably from Macintosh, Apple, and Steve Jobs.</p>
<p>Thanks to my decision in later 2010 to get un Mac instead of un PC, which looks really profound now. I got amazed by both the graceful hardware and the powerful software. It was the first time that I understood how surprising the combination of humanity and technology can be. Thanks to such experience, I eventually decided to be un UI/UX designer, though not only UI/UX. I feel like managing interfaces in my own mind. My first Macintosh was the initial acceleration.</p>
<p>Macintosh is the symbol of that stage and was un essential milestone along with personal electronic devices' history, where most modern genius are devoting themselves on, where I will also engage in. Hard to imagine what if I didn't decide to get un Mac. Hard to imagine what if I got un Mac more later. Hard to imagine what if I failed in getting un computer before 16.</p>
<p>Therefore, I appreciate Macintosh much more than others do. My appreciating is beyond admiring, but acknowledging.</p>
<p>The encounter, shall be important in not only my life, but also this era.</p>
