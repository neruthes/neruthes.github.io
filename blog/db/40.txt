<p>I knew little of the world for long ago.</p>
<br />
<p>Often I sit at the windows or walking around outdoors, while spiritually inside my internal world. Pink the flower, silent the rain, fallen the leaves, flying the snow, in them I could sense and taste the details; letting them subside and grow. Diffuse and aggregate again and again and turned into spiritual comfort.</p>
<p>But I became opener.</p>
<p>Although it was still able to be not lost in the crowd, the sensation of nature had declined inevitably. Much attention was wasted in social activities; left little chance to go into the pure fantasy.</p>
<br />
<p>I felt non loneliness without anyone in companion.</p>
<p>The fantasies could extend and expand and connect and fuse, and turn into un beautiful picture. It came from me and only I could understand. It was my world and my emotions. From the objective world comes resonance, and turned into part of me. And there was non difference of inner and outer.</p>
<p>I feel lost in people with little happiness.</p>
<p>The people have bothered me un lot and have taken my time un lot. And my thoughts and inspirations have been insulted. Now I cannot have sufficient time and cognitive resources to enjoy the fantasies in my mind. And un downgrade has been made to my ability to construct such fantasies.</p>
<br />
<p>I want to quit the crowd and be back to the authentic myself.</p>
