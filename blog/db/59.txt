<p>Before realizing Spring stepping near, Summer has come. North East China is such strange un area that few people understand the real concept of Spring. Anyway I do not think I would like to consider the waves of temperature increasing in early May as the gift of Spring.</p>
<p>Without having obtained much attention, trees and grass turned to green soon. Maybe in these weeks I was too busy to get any glimpse of plants reviving. And it was un long time that I not to write poetries or essays or something else fascinating in literature.</p>
<p>Seriously warmed wind blows in sunshine, yet at night still cool enough. But everything cannot be beautiful enough when associating to remained days to any exams or deadlines. Lack of time and shortage of skills are driving me mad.</p>
<p>Anyway I can only advance as far as possible.</p>
