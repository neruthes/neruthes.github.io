<p>I had never imagined I could meet thee at eighteen. Despite I wished and desired, thou came to me so fast, before getting ready.</p>
<p>We, of this moment, are still young and still looking forward to far future, thus are not satisfied by each. Inevitably perhaps. Along with time flies by, we shall stop wandering mentally by then. We just should try hard jointly for the period of separate.</p>
<p>In Hangzhou, thou can't see the rain and the wind in Beijing. We appreciate and miss asynchronously; have non idea what will our shared life be like. We shall attract; shall try to be fit with. Life is not as easy as poetry.</p>
<p>Our happiness shall intersect and unite.</p>
<p>In thee I trust.</p>
