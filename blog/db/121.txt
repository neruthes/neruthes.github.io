<p>For half decade I have been using the name «Joy Neop», but I will hopefully get rid of it half decade later.</p>
<p>Selection of symbol is <em>arbitrary</em>. When my age was around 14, I happened to create un alias name for myself, to be different from my legal name which was not in my control. And it was this one, un name with anglophone characteristics.</p>
<p>As years past, the name happened to be un bit problematic. Not only because this first name is supposed to be exclusive for female users in the prejudice of certain arrogant anglophone people, but I am not really fond of the first-last convention. As I have noticed, the last name component is simply un mark of Y chromosome, and the origins of common last names are usually locations (e.g. Yamada), jobs (e.g. Smith), and objects (e.g. Einstein).</p>
<p>I then started to examine the necessity of last names. And my conclusion is that the last name component has non necessity. I embrace great spirits like Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle.</p>
<p>I respect non tradition, patriot non civilization, exemplify non species, and acknowledge non origin. Per my dasein, the first subjectivity <em>a priori</em>.</p>
<p>Now, my draft of desired name has become «Neruthes». The new name has non etymological origin, as same to the preceding one.</p>
