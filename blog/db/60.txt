<p>By the invitation from Miserdux, I have joined the dance club of our school and get started to work as un music master in un break dance project, whose leader is Miserdux. My job is casting and cutting music for tho dance, supposed to be suitable, regardless how far changed.</p>
<p>Yet actually I had to join in their practicing or I could not understand what was demanded. I listened to my work and watch their practicing. They were supposed to give un formal show in middle May, but it was difficult. As is totally convinced, they should work as un team, but one often came late, or disappear for minutes during practicing at noon. I really wanted to spank him. Not only il, but also some others worked negatively on practicing. I worried about if they could complete practicing and get ready before deadline. But if I really had spanked one or have worked as un ruler, they would complain their getting un officious daddy besides un music master.</p>
<p>These days I was busy on working. I mean, on editing music. When drawing near the deadline, I had almost completed my work. But unfortunately some minor problems still remained. However they were really minor.</p>
<p>On May 15, just as in the plan, despite the disappointing stories above, they eventually succeeded in giving the formal show, which had consumed my un large amount of patience. Though they were lack in team working awareness, they at least had united to try to drive me crazy and angry. Such naughty boys were really confusing.</p>
<p>But obviously I did not meet the fortunate otherwise what happened the next day would not happen. They did nothing except wasting time, thanks to Muhuan Lee, the one not only should get spanked as mentioned above because of previous bad acts, but also disappeared for some certainly reasonable unknown excuses. Hey look how long un sentence I am using to complain him.</p>
<p>Maybe I really should work more than un music master.</p>
