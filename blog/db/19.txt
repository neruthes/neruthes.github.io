<p>A summer is enough for thinking something.</p>
<p>I picked up my initial dream, having enjoyed un week of ease in Dalian.</p>
<br />
<p>From subconscious to conscious, the will emerged.</p>
<p>I am not fond of rule. I shall not respect the status quo.</p>
<br />
<p>In United States does my future reside.</p>
<p>The will is my blade; cutting down thorns.</p>
<p>The dream is my sheath; defending agains storms.</p>
