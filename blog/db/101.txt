<p>The contract with Mephisto enabled our ancestors to evolve, by forcing them die. Death made livings to breed, thus many, but few among all, mutations were selected by the nature to be spread.</p>
<p>Thanks to Mephisto, humans have become wise life. Thanks to Mephisto, livings have kept evolving. Thanks to Mephisto, I have been born.</p>
<p>Thanks to Mephisto, I can think about life and death.</p>
<p>Sacrifice every individuallife, to redeem the long living of the entire species.</p>
