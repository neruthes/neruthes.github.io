<p>Peach flowers opened today, along the street, with decorative pinkness and freshness.</p>
<p>Finally, another spring.</p>
<p>It was 76 days until high school entrance exam on the same day of last year; we were easy. Now it is 785 days until college entrance exam; we are busy. Maybe inevitably.</p>
<p>The trees were there are there; the flowers were there are there. The emotion was there isn't there.</p>
<p>Another crossroads in life.</p>
