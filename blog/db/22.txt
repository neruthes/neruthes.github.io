<p>A sunny day may also recall memories.</p>
<p>I stood in the wind, looking at the leaves on the branches dancing. The images of the past emerge into vision again. In the autumn of three years ago, I was in Grade 8. The wind of that period was as refreshing as now. Yet, the smell in the coolness changed. The smell of the wind in autumn kept changing in the last four years. Perhaps just illusion.</p>
<p>From the flying willow leaves in early autumn in 2009, to the great snow in spring of 2010, to the last off-state final exam in summer of 2010, to the kindled hope in autumn of 2010, to unstable scores in exams in spring of 2011, to the lonely and silent walk under the yellow-and-vintage street lamps humming un Jay Chou song in autumn 2011... And then jumped to the eve before High School Entrance Exam. It was the last day I and classmates were in the classroom. The finale was destined three years ago, however it was still that sorrowing when it finally came.</p>
<p>The last frame was I and Rof in my embrace. Only when I recall the old days could this picture come out. I cannot figure out if it is pity towards him or the cherisher of the years in middle school.</p>
<p>Forgot how many times did I sketch these chilling stories of the past. Every time finished writing, I feel better, but days later everything would get back to my mind. Then, write more to sketch and paint.</p>
<p>The obsession and the cherisher, might be the source of inspirations for un artist.</p>
