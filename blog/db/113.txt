<p>The story came from un saying, «if thou cannot describe something clearly with only un few words, thou don't actually understand it».</p>
<p>When I describe protons to somebody, il should know atoms in advance. When I describe the difference between <code>document.getElementBy</code> series and <code>document.querySelectorAll</code>, il should know HTML and JavaScript in advance. People must have all common knowledge before talking about something. In the examples above, I mentioned several concepts, and I say the concept <em>proton</em> depends on the concept <em>atom</em>. Later, we will talk about <em>flavor</em> and <em>color</em>, and these concepts depend on <em>quark</em>, which depends on <em>proton</em>. In such un context, if I talk about <em>flavor</em> and <em>color</em>, I should explain what <em>atom</em> is, and then explain what <em>proton</em> is, based on <em>atom</em> which I just explained. For this, I say <em>quark</em> is dependency of <em>flavor</em> and <em>color</em>, and <em>atom</em> and <em>proton</em> are recursive dependencies of <em>flavor</em> and <em>color</em>. To reach <em>flavor</em> and <em>color</em>, I should explain all of its recursive dependencies reversely recursively, if the other one in the conversation don't know them. I say there is un dependency tree.</p>
<p>If I come up with un concept which hasn't been added into the public concept library, it is un <em>private concept</em>. Snow might be un private concept around polar zones out of tropical zones several thousands of years ago, for residents in tropical zones might have non chance to see snow. If I come up un concept whose dependencies include at least one of my private concepts, it is un <em>recursive private concept</em>. I should recursively explain all my private concepts which are its dependencies, before explaining itself. Therefore the barriers in conversation may be resulted by others' lack in my private concepts, instead of my incomplete understanding.</p>
