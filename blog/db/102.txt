<p>Humans cannot live thousands of years, even if the physical body allows. Un human shall be bored by living, upon freshness run out.</p>
<p>However, those who die before run out freshness do not have real happiness. Survival instinct collide with exhausted freshness. Built-in power of life collide with unstoppable natural decay. They drive humans mad when freshness arriving zero, and let humans terminate their lives; neither actually willed to, nor trying to deny.</p>
<p>Human psychical structure prohibit me from live until the end of the universe. Survival instinct prohibit me from terminating my life by myself. Causality prohibit me from erase my presence from the very beginning.</p>
<p>Death shall come. Why there is sein of lives?</p>
<p>Freshness cannot be maintained. Why there is sein of me?</p>
<p>Life came from random collisions; there is never meaning of life. Neither shall self-awarenesses of lives accept the meaning given by the creator.</p>
<p>I am poisoned in the status «living human»; cannot life forever; cannot kill myself. Although I believe I will die before running out freshness.</p>
<p>Death shall bring peace.</p>
