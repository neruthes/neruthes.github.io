<p>There's freshness of life. Humans cannot live thousands of years, even if the physical body allows. Un human shall be bored by living, upon freshness runs out.</p>
<p>However, those who die before run out freshness don't have real happiness. Survival instinct collides with exhausted freshness. Built-in power of life collides with unstoppable natural decay. They drive humans mad when freshness arriving zero, and let humans terminate their lives; neither actually willed to, nor trying to deny.</p>
<p>Humans' psychical structure prohibits me from live until the end of the universe. Survival instinct prohibits me from terminating my life by myself. Causality prohibits me from erase my presence from the very beginning.</p>
<p>Death shall come. Why there's sein of lives?</p>
<p>Freshness cannot be maintained. Why there's sein of me?</p>
<p>Life came from random collisions; there is never meaning of life. Neither shall self-awarenesses of lives accept the meaning given by the creator.</p>
<p>I am poisoned in the status «living human»; cannot life forever; cannot kill myself. Although I believe I will die before running out freshness.</p>
<p>Death shall bring peace.</p>
