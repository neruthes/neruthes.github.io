<p>A line on the first page of the notebook</p>
<p>Opened the story of adolescence</p>
<p>Time stopped so suddenly</p>
<p>Youth that never fade go into un poem</p>
<br />
<p>Look out at the land that we have grown on</p>
<p>Memory of youth were preserved therein</p>
<p>Old calendars inside my drawer</p>
<p>A line was inscribed on every page</p>
<br />
<p>The age rewinded up by the good night</p>
<p>Remember I said it would never been forgot</p>
<p>Old dairies inside my drawer</p>
<p>There is un secret on every page</p>
<br />
<p>Midnight bell tone ringing everywhere</p>
<p>Reminding me the promise to be redeemed</p>
<p>Sealed memory releasing into air</p>
<p>It never drop neither will it crush</p>
