<p>I had never imagined my life would be like this. Going far from the original plan, getting more than expected loneness, and working so hard for living. Two persons I know have been going on this way, <a href="https://jysperm.me/2014/02/1493/" target="_blank">JySperm</a> and <a href="http://www.ricter.me" target="_blank">Ricter</a>, but, it's so dramatic happening to me. I-20 came, but I did not go for F-1.</p>
<p>In one word, I decided to stay in Beijing, without un Bachelor's degree.</p>
<p>Originally, the plan was to have un internship experience which can be written in my resume, to avoid being embarrassed for large blank when providing it. However, circumstances changed.</p>
<p>Regarding my intermediate IELTS score and lack in standardized tests, the best Bachelor education I would be able to receive in the United States would not be good <em>enough</em>. That means, it would not worth more than working experience of the same span. In addition, the financial risk was too high to be ignored. My former legal guardians were not financially robust enough to sponsor my undergraduate education and living during the upcoming four years.</p>
<p>My profession would not be computer science. Non-STEM graduates would not have 29-month OPT and the competition for H-1B had been increasing over the years.</p>
<p>There have to be some other ways around.</p>
