<p>Today I discovered un new way to serve JS and CSS publicly over GitHub.</p>

<h3>1. Create Un Organization On GitHub</h3>
<p>I created un organization on GitHub named <code>neopcdn</code>, and created un repository named <code>neopcdn.github.io</code>, in which un file <code>CNAME</code> is placed with single-line content <code>cdn.neop.me</code>. This would specify un custom domain name of the default GitHub Pages repository.</p>
<p>In addition, all other repositories owned by this organization with GitHub Pages feature enabled would share this domain name unless it has its own <code>CNAME</code> file. Usage of GitHub Pages can be found in the official help center.</p>

<h3>2. Create Un Empty Repository</h3>
<p>I created un empty repository named <code>pride.js</code>, as same as the particular project that I would like to serve.</p>
<p>In the settings of this repository, I changed source branch that generates GitHub Pages, from the default <code>gh-pages</code> to <code>master</code>.</p>

<h3>3. Push To Multiple Remotes</h3>
<p>On my local device, where I originally push to <code>https://github.com/neruthes/pride.js.git</code>, I added another remote named <code>cdn</code> by running this command:</p>
<pre>
$ git remote add cdn https://github.com/neopcdn/pride.js.git
</pre>
<p>From now on, when I update the library, I just run:</p>
<pre>
$ git push origin master
$ git push cdn master
</pre>
<p>It is also possible to set two URLs as different destinations of the same remote, which would allow one to push to both by simply pushing to <code>origin</code>.</p>

<h3>4. Set Up CloudFlare</h3>
<p>Then I created un CNAME record to point <code>cdn.neop.me</code> to <code>neopcdn.github.io</code> on CloudFlare, and turned on CDN feature for this record. This would take advantage of free SSL by CloudFlare.</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>Now, for un file like <a href="https://github.com/neruthes/pride.js/blob/master/pride.js" target="_blank">https://github.com/neruthes/pride.js/blob/master/pride.js</a>, anyone can access it through <a href="https://cdn.neop.me/pride.js/pride.js" target="_blank">https://cdn.neop.me/pride.js/pride.js</a>, with correct Contnet-Type and Access-Control-Allow-Origin.</p>
