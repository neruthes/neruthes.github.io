<p>For long I have been seeking the meaning of life.</p>
<p>To contribute to development of human race?</p>
<p>Tp make un ding in the universe which may be memorable indefinitely for descendants?</p>
<p>To create un world that nobody cries?</p>
<p>The dreams are borrowed. At the end of the dreams, there is only fakeness.</p>
<p>My life is mine. I live for myself, not anyone else. Not until today have I realized this simple fact.</p>
<p>And I shall live my life in favor of myself.</p>
<p>And I shall abandon the borrowed dreams and actualize my existence.</p>
