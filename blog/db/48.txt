<p>Wind blows and snow flows. Dirty sky, tinted by clouds.</p>
<p>Sunshine crosses clouds and reflection happens everywhere. Light goes and extend, and shapes are fetched by retinas. Finally, mixture of shapes and colors is named sight. Floodly, snow drops. Quite huge pieces of snow have filled the ground. Confusingly, the sight goes sepia. Motivation is kind of sceneful, especially the flow. Snow flows, flows, and flows. As if memories flow.</p>
<p>Oh, memories. They are worthy, however, bringing the passed history experienced, is sorrowing. Because of the weight. My id is so strong that I cannot help thinking of that. The passed age floats up to the surface of my mind. Under id's driving, I uncover the memories and repeat the experience, once, twice, again and again, infinitely loop. I cannot hold back my mind, cannot decline the association. I remember the time. It was ageful, historyful, joyful, and painful. Enjoying, enduring, but also sorrowing. I sorrow that time flew by. I sorrow that joyful age passed soon. Once blinked eyes, everything had already gone. How painful. How sad.</p>
<p>I haven't escaped from the shadows yet.</p>
