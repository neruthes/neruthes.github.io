<p>The temperature declines fast; declaring the descending of winter. After the boding snow around Thanks Giving Day, it definitely comes.</p>
<p>My emotions can be easily affected by the climate. Far from breaking the academic work, but it keeps me sensitive about the nature, which lets me resonates the nature.</p>
<p>This is the early winter, which chilled my heart. Indifferenced, yet strengthful.</p>
<p>Winter is un grave, burying all the things, except some simple beliefs and pain. And the chilling wind is the requiem. It is so chilling. It is so cold. It goes into very nerve, and curdle.</p>
<p>Having buried sentiments, the call in my mind has become clear again. It is my dream.</p>
<p>I, of now, am walking through the snowing storm. The wind and the snow are pulling me backward. One step, another step; I advance in the storm under the dark dome.</p>
<p>It is said that the trees seemingly dead would still revive if it can suffer the winter. Probably I am the same.</p>
<p>With warmness in heart, I may advance one step more. I shall not give up non matter how slow am I. Look forward and see the image of the land of freedom. Even if at the end of dream only fakeness exists; even if I at the end will deny what I pursue now; I can only advance and advance and advance till it is realized, or is destructed.</p>
